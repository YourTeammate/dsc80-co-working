    "# Introduction to Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build *[statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)* using public domain books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given \"language\" (the precise term is \"corpus\" or \"corpora\"). Here, \"language\" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. Applications of language models are found in areas such as language generation, authorship attribution, auto-complete / word-suggestion, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will learn about a simple but effective type of language model (LM) called N-gram models. Given a sentence (that is, a sequence of words $w = w_1\\ldots w_n$), you would like to understand the probability that sentence is used: \n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n)$$\n",
    "However, sentences are built from words, and the likelihood that a word occurs where it does, depends on the words it follows. This points to using *conditional probability* to understand $P(w)$. That is, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "This is also called the *chain rule* for probabilities.  \n",
    "**Example:** Consider the sentence $w = $ `when I eat pizza, I wipe off the grease.`\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\mbox{when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ eat | when I})\\cdot P(\\mbox{ pizza | when I eat}) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(\\mbox{ grease | when I eat pizza, I wipe off the})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the probability that the sentence occurs is the product of the probability that each subsequent word follows the words that came before. For example, the probability $P(\\mbox{ pizza | when I eat})$ is pretty high, as pizza is something that you eat; thus, this term would contribute to this sentence having a higher probability of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram language models\n",
    "\n",
    "In the description above, the probability that any word in the sentence (e.g. 'grease') depends on *every* word that preceded it (e.g. 'when'). However, it's often the case the likelihood a word appears in a sentence is influenced more by *nearby* words. \n",
    "* N-gram language models capture this concept that only nearby words matter; they assume the probability a word occurs only depends on the previous $(N−1)$ words. \n",
    "* That is, an N-gram model says: $P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: trigram model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the sentence $w = $ `when I eat pizza, I wipe off the grease.`\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\mbox{when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ eat | when I})\\cdot P(\\mbox{ pizza | I eat}) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(\\mbox{ the | wipe off}) \\cdot P(\\mbox{ grease | off the})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this example, we see the trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when considering the likelihood of the end word 'grease'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Given the descriptions and definitions above, we define the **N-grams of a text** to be the list of sliding windows of length N.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, the trigrams of the sentence $w$ in the example above are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'eat'), ('I', 'eat', 'pizza'), ... , ('wipe', 'off', 'the'), ('off', 'the', 'grease')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing an N-gram language model\n",
    "\n",
    "N-gram language models are a collection of conditional probabilities for sequences of words of length $N$. For example, in a trigram model, for every 3-word sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, you need to compute:\n",
    "$$P(w_1,w_2,w_3) = P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram-sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the dataset and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram-sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a general N-gram model, the conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-grams by the (N-1)-grams they follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the probabilities of a language model from a book requires breaking up the text of book into sequences of words. This process is called *tokenization*. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*. In this project tokens will include not only whole words, but also punctuation and other terms. Below are a few examples of other types of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation like `,.;'`. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. come before a `.` in an N-gram) and begin sentences (i.e. come after a `.` in an N-gram).\n",
    "* We have special 'START' and 'END' tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create our language model. Thus, you will use two ascii hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `\\x02` (used for 'beginning of text')\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `\\x03` (used for 'end of text')\n"

Youâ\\x80\\x99re a native, arâ\\x80\\x99nt you? When do you\\nthink the rain will go off?--do you ever have any fine weather here? I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t see the good of a fine country when it rains for ever and ever!\\nWhat do you do with yourselves, you people, all the year round in such a\\nmelancholy place?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou see we know no betterâ\\x80\\x9d--said the farmer of Ramore, who came in at\\nthis moment to the porch of his house, where the young gentleman was\\nstanding, confronted by young Colin, who would have exploded in boyish\\nrage before now, if he had not been restrained by the knowledge that his\\nmother was within hearing--â\\x80\\x9cand, wet or dry, the country-side comes\\nnatural to them it belongs to. If it werena for a twinge oâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nrheumatics noo and then--and my lads are ower young for that--itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ngrand country. If itâ\\x80\\x99s nae great comfort to the purse, itâ\\x80\\x99s aye a\\npleasure to the eâ\\x80\\x99e. Come in to the fire, and take a seat till the rain\\nblows by. _My_ lads,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin of Ramore, with a twinkle of\\napprobation in his eye, â\\x80\\x9ctake little heed whether itâ\\x80\\x99s rain or shine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m of a different opinion,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t like walking\\nup to the ankles in those filthy roads.â\\x80\\x9d He was a boy of fifteen or so,\\nthe same age as young Colin, who stood opposite him breathing hard with\\nopposition and natural enmity; but the smart Etonian considered himself\\nmuch more a man of the world and of experience than Colin the elder, and\\nlooked on the boy with calm contempt. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be glad to dry my boots if\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll let me,â\\x80\\x9d he said, holding up a foot which beside young Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsturdy hoof looked preternaturally small and dainty.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA fit like a lassieâ\\x80\\x99s!â\\x80\\x9d the country boy said to himself with\\nresponsive disdain. Young Colin laughed half aloud as his natural enemy\\nfollowed his father into the house.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s feared to wet his feet,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, with a chuckle of mockery,\\nholding forth his own, which to his consciousness were never dry. Any\\nmoralist, who had happened to be at hand, might have suggested to Colin\\nthat a faculty for acquiring and keeping up wet feet during every hour\\nof the twenty-four which he did not spend in bed was no great matter to\\nbrag of: but then moralists did not flourish at Ramore. The boy made a\\nrush out through the soft-falling incessant rain, dashed down upon the\\nshingly beach with an impetuosity which dispersed the wet pebbles on all\\nsides of him, and jumping into the boat, pushed out upon the loch, not\\nfor any particular purpose, but to relieve a little his indignation and\\nboyish discomfiture. The boat was clumsy enough, and young Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nâ\\x80\\x9cstyleâ\\x80\\x9d in rowing was not of a high order, but it caught the quick eye\\nof the Eton lad, as he glanced out from the window.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat fellow can row,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, but aloud, with the\\n_nonchalance_ of his race, as he went forward, passing the great cradle\\nwhich stood on one side of the fire, to the chair which the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwife had placed for him. She received with many kindly homely\\ninvitations and welcomes the serene young potentate as he approached her\\nfireside throne.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome awa--come in to the fire. The roads are past speaking oâ\\x80\\x99 in this\\nsoft weather. Maybe the young gentleman would like to change his feet,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the soft-voiced woman, who sat in a wicker-work easy chair, with a\\nvery small baby, and cheeks still pale from its recent arrival. She had\\nsoft, dark, beaming eyes, and the softest pink flush coming and going\\nover her face, and was wrapped in a shawl, and evidently considered an\\ninvalid--which, for the mother of five or six children, and the mistress\\nof Ramore Farm, was an honourable but inconvenient luxury. â\\x80\\x9cI could\\nbring you a pair of my Colinâ\\x80\\x99s stockings in a moment. I dare say theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\nabout your size--or if you would like to gang ben the house into the\\nspare room, and change them----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thanks; but there is no need for that,â\\x80\\x9d said the visitor, with a\\nslight blush, being conscious, as even an Eton boy could not help being,\\nof the humorous observation of the farmer, who had come in behind him,\\nand in whose eyes it was evident the experienced â\\x80\\x9cmanâ\\x80\\x9d of the fifth form\\nwas a less sublime personage than he gave himself credit for being. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nam living down at the Castle,â\\x80\\x9d he added, hastily; â\\x80\\x9cI lost my way on the\\nhills, and got dreadfully wet; otherwise I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind the rain.â\\x80\\x9d And he\\nheld the dainty boots, which steamed in the heat, to the fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you maunna gang out to the hills in such slight things again,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMrs. Campbell, looking at them compassionately; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll get you a pair of\\nmy Colinâ\\x80\\x99s strong shoes and stockings thatâ\\x80\\x99ll keep your feet warm. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\njust lay the wean in the cradle, and you can slip them off the time Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\naway,â\\x80\\x9d said the good woman, with a passing thought for the boyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbashfulness. But the farmer caught her by the arm and kept her in her\\nchair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose thereâ\\x80\\x99s mair folk than you about the house, Jeannie?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nher husband, â\\x80\\x9cthough youâ\\x80\\x99re so positive about doing everything yourselâ\\x80\\x99.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll tell the lass; and I advise you, young gentleman, not to be\\nshamefaced, but take the wifeâ\\x80\\x99s advice. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great quality oâ\\x80\\x99 hers to\\nken whatâ\\x80\\x99s good for other folk.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI ken by myselâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said the gentle-voiced wife, with a smile--and she\\ngot up and went softly to the window, while the young stranger took her\\ncounsel. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s Colin out in the boat again, in a perfect pour of\\nrain,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, with a gentle sigh--â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll get his death oâ\\x80\\x99\\ncauld; but, to be sure, if he had been to get his death that gate, it\\nwould have come afore now. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a great deal of rain in this country,\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll be thinking?--aâ\\x80\\x99 the strangers say sae; but I canna see that they\\nbide away for aâ\\x80\\x99 that, though theyâ\\x80\\x99re aye grumbling. And if youâ\\x80\\x99re fond\\noâ\\x80\\x99 the hills, youâ\\x80\\x99ll get reconciled to the rain. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen mony an\\nafternoon when there was scarce an hour without two or three rainbows,\\nand the mist liftinâ\\x80\\x99 and droppinâ\\x80\\x99 again, as if it was set to music. I\\ncanna say I have any experience myselâ\\x80\\x99, but so far as ane can imagine, a\\nclear sky and a shining sun, day after day, would be awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nmonotonous--like a face wiâ\\x80\\x99 a set smile. I tell the bairns itâ\\x80\\x99s as guid\\nas a fairy-tale to watch the clouds--and itâ\\x80\\x99s no common sunshine when it\\ndoes come, but a kind oâ\\x80\\x99 wistful light, as if he couldna tell whether he\\never might see you again; but itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 when the crops are out, as they\\nare the noo--the Lord forgive me for speaking as if I liked the rain!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd by this time her boy-visitor, having succeeded, much to his comfort\\nand disgust, in replacing his wet _chaussures_ by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s dry, warm\\nstockings and monstrous shoes, Mrs. Campbell came back to her seat and\\nlifted her baby again on her knee. The baby was of angelic disposition,\\nand perfectly disposed to make itself comfortable in its cradle, but the\\nusually active mother evidently made it a kind of excuse to herself for\\nher compulsory repose.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe wife gets easy to her poetry,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, with a smile,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich is pleasant enough to hear, though it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t keep the grain from\\nsprouting. Youâ\\x80\\x99re fond oâ\\x80\\x99 the hills, you Southland folk? Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be from\\nlevel land yourselâ\\x80\\x99, I reckon?--where aâ\\x80\\x99 the craps were safe housed\\nafore the weather broke? We have nae particular reason to complain yet,\\nif we could but make sure oâ\\x80\\x99 a week or twaâ\\x80\\x99s dry weather. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll be the\\nholidays still with you?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said young Frankland, slightly disgusted at being so calmly set\\ndown as a schoolboy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear thereâ\\x80\\x99s some grand schools in England,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell; â\\x80\\x9cnoâ\\x80\\x99\\nthat theyâ\\x80\\x99re to compare wiâ\\x80\\x99 Edinburgh, I suppose? Colin, thereâ\\x80\\x99s some\\nsherry wine in the press; I think a glass wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 harm the young\\ngentleman after his wetting. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll take something any-way, if you would\\ntell Jess. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hungry work climbing our hills for a laddie like you--at\\nleast if I may reckon by my ain laddies that are aye ready at meal\\ntimes,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, with a gracious smile that would not\\nhave misbecome a duchess. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll be at ane oâ\\x80\\x99 the great schools, I\\nsuppose? I aye like to learn what I can when thereâ\\x80\\x99s ony opportunity. I\\nwould like my Colin to get aâ\\x80\\x99 the advantages, for heâ\\x80\\x99s well worthy oâ\\x80\\x99 a\\ngood education, though weâ\\x80\\x99re rather out of the way of it here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am at Eton,â\\x80\\x9d said the English boy, who could scarcely refrain from a\\nlittle ridicule at the idea of sharing â\\x80\\x9caâ\\x80\\x99 the advantagesâ\\x80\\x9d of that\\ndistinguished foundation with a colt like young Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut I should\\nthink you would find it too far off to send your son there,â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\nall his good breeding being unable to smother a slight laugh as he\\nlooked round the homely apartment, and wondered what â\\x80\\x9call the fellowsâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwould say to a schoolfellow from Ramore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNae occasion to laugh, young gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin the elder; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbeen Lord Chancellors oâ\\x80\\x99 England, and generals oâ\\x80\\x99 aâ\\x80\\x99 the forces, that\\nhave come out of houses nae better than this. I am just as ye find me,\\nbut I wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 say what might befall our Colin. In this country thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnae law to bind a man, to the same line oâ\\x80\\x99 life as his fathers. Despise\\nnaebody, my man, or you may live to be despised in your turn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said young Frankland, blushing hotly, and feeling\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s shoes weigh upon his feet like lead; â\\x80\\x9cI did not intend----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, no,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, soothingly; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the maister that takes\\nup fancies; but nae doubt Eton is far ower expensive for the like of us,\\nand a bit callant like you may laugh without ony offence. When Colin\\ncomes to be a man heâ\\x80\\x99ll make his ain company, or Iâ\\x80\\x99m mistaâ\\x80\\x99en; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nno wish to pit him amang lords and gentlemenâ\\x80\\x99s sons that would jeer at\\nhis homely ways. And they tell me thereâ\\x80\\x99s schules in Edinburgh far afore\\nonything thatâ\\x80\\x99s kent in England--besides the college,â\\x80\\x9d said the mother,\\nwith a little pride; â\\x80\\x9cour Colinâ\\x80\\x99s done with his schuling. Education\\ntakes longer wiâ\\x80\\x99 the like of you. After Martinmas heâ\\x80\\x99s gaun in to\\nGlasgow to begin his _course_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo this proud intimation the young visitor listened in silence, not\\nbeing able to connect the roughshod lad in the boat with a University,\\nwhatever might be its form. He addressed himself instead to the scones\\nand butter which Jess the servant, a handsome, powerful woman of five\\nfeet eight or so, had set before him on the table. Jess lingered a\\nlittle, ere she left the room, to pinch the babyâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks, and say,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBless the lamb! eh, what a guid bairn!â\\x80\\x9d with patriarchal friendly\\nfamiliarity. Meanwhile the farmer sat down, with a thump which made it\\ncreak, upon the large old haircloth sofa which filled up one end of the\\nroom.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve heard thereâ\\x80\\x99s a great difference between our colleges and the\\ncolleges in England,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWiâ\\x80\\x99 you they dinna train a lad to\\nonything in particular; wiâ\\x80\\x99 us itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 for a profession,--the kirk, or\\nthe law, or physic, as it may be,--a far mair sensible system. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nsure itâ\\x80\\x99s just civil, though,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, with a quaint mingling\\nof Scotch complacency and Scotch politeness, â\\x80\\x9cto talk to a stranger of\\nnaething but the inferiority oâ\\x80\\x99 his ain country. It may be aâ\\x80\\x99 true\\nenough, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s pleasanter topics oâ\\x80\\x99 discourse. The Castleâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nbonnie situation? and if youâ\\x80\\x99re fond oâ\\x80\\x99 the water, yachting, and\\nboating, and that kind oâ\\x80\\x99 thing, thereâ\\x80\\x99s grand opportunity amang our\\nlochs.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve got a yacht,â\\x80\\x9d said the boy, who found the scones much to his\\ntaste, and began to feel a glow of comfort diffusing itself through his\\ninner man--â\\x80\\x9cthe fastest sailer I know. We made a little run yesterday\\ndown to the Kyles; but Sir Thomas prefers the grouse, though itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nawfully hard work, I can tell you, going up those hills. Itâ\\x80\\x99s so beastly\\nwet,â\\x80\\x9d said the young hero. â\\x80\\x9cI never was down here before; but Sir Thomas\\ncomes every year to the Highlands; he likes it--heâ\\x80\\x99s as strong as a\\nhorse--but I prefer the yacht, for my part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd whoâ\\x80\\x99s Sir Thomas, if ane may speer--some friend?â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwife.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh--heâ\\x80\\x99s my father!â\\x80\\x9d said the Etonian; and a natural flush of\\nshamefacedness at acknowledging such a relationship rose upon the\\ncountenance of the British boy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour father?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, with some amazement, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nqueer way to speak of your father; and have you ony brothers and sisters\\nthat youâ\\x80\\x99re this lang distance off your lane,--and your mamma maybe\\nanxious about you?â\\x80\\x9d continued the kind mother, with a wistful look of\\ninquiry. She was prepared to be sorry for him, concluding that a boy who\\nspoke of his father in such terms, must be motherless, and a neglected\\nchild. It was the most tender kind of curiosity which animated the good\\nwoman. She formed a theory about the lad on the spot, as women do, and\\nconcluded that his cruel father paid no regard to him, and that the\\nboyâ\\x80\\x99s heart had been hardened by neglect and want of love. â\\x80\\x9cFigure our\\nColin caâ\\x80\\x99ing the maister Mr. Campbell!â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, and looked\\nvery pitifully at young Frankland, who ate his scone without any\\nconsciousness of her amiable imaginations.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m not afraid,â\\x80\\x9d said the calm youth. â\\x80\\x9cShe knows better; thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nten of us, and some one of the family comes to grief most days, you\\nknow. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s used to that. Besides, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get home long before Sir Thomas.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s only four now, and I suppose one could walk down from here--how\\nsoon?â\\x80\\x9d All this time he went on so steadily at the scones and the milk,\\nthat the heart of the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife warmed to the possessor of such a\\nfrank and appreciative appetite.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou might put the horse in the gig and drive the young gentleman down,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the soft-hearted woman; â\\x80\\x9cor Colin could row him in the boat as far\\nas the pier. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a lang walk for such a callant, and youâ\\x80\\x99re no thrang.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 to think oâ\\x80\\x99 the rain, how itâ\\x80\\x99s taking the bread out of us\\npoor folkâ\\x80\\x99s mouths; but to be sure itâ\\x80\\x99s the Lordâ\\x80\\x99s will--if it be na,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the homely speculator, â\\x80\\x9cthat the weatherâ\\x80\\x99s ane of the things that\\nhas been permitted, for wise reasons, to faâ\\x80\\x99 into Ither Hands; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nsure, judging by the way it comes just when itâ\\x80\\x99s noâ\\x80\\x99 wanted, ane might\\nthink so, mony a time, in this country side. But ah! itâ\\x80\\x99s sinfuâ\\x80\\x99 to\\nspeak,--and look at yon bonnie rainbow,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, turning to the\\nwindow with her baby in her arms.\\n\\nYoung Frankland got up slowly as he finished his scone. He was only\\npartially sensible of the extreme beauty of the scene before him; but\\nthe farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife stood with her baby in her arms, with hidden lights\\nkindling in her soft eyes, expanding and beaming over the lovely\\nlandscape. It did her good like a cordial; though even Colin, her\\nsensible husband, looked on, with a smile upon his good-humoured\\ncountenance, and was a little amused and much puzzled, as he had been a\\nhundred times before--seeing his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure in those common and\\nevery-day processes of nature, to know why.\\n\\nYoung Colin in the boat understood better,--he was lying on his oars\\ngazing at it the same moment; arrested in his petulant boyish thoughts,\\nas she had been in her anxieties, the lad came out of, and lost himself\\nin the scene. The sun had burst out suddenly upon the noble range of\\nhills which stretched across the upper end of the loch--that wistful\\ntender sun which shone out always, dazzling with pathetic gleams of\\nsudden love in this country, â\\x80\\x9cas if he couldna tell whether he might\\never see you again,â\\x80\\x9d as Mrs. Campbell said--and, just catching the\\nskirts of the rain, had flung a double rainbow across the sheltered\\nlovely curve of the upper banks. One side of the arch stooping over the\\nheathery hillside, lighted it up with an unearthly glory, and the other\\ncame down in stately columns one grand shaft within the other, with\\nsolid magnificence and steadiness, into the water. Young Frankland at\\nthe window could not help thinking within himself, what a beautiful\\npicture it would make, â\\x80\\x9cif any of those painter fellows could do a\\nrainbow;â\\x80\\x9d but as for young Colin in the boat, the impulse in his heart\\nwas to dash up to those heavenly archways, and embrace the shining\\npillar, and swing himself aloft half-boy, half-poet, to that celestial\\nworld, where fiery columns may stand fast upon moving waters--and all is\\ntrue, but nothing real. The hills, for their share, lay very quiet,\\ntaking no part in the momentary drama of the elements; standing passive,\\nletting the sudden light search them over and over, as if seeking for\\nhidden treasure. Just in the midst of the blackness of the rain, never\\nwas light and joy so sweet and sudden. The farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife came away from\\nthe window with a sigh of pleasure, as the baby stirred in her arms;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, but the worldâ\\x80\\x99s bonnie, bonnie!â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, with a\\nfeeling that some event of joyful importance had just been enacted\\nbefore her. As for the boy on the loch, who, being younger, was more\\nabstracted from common affairs, his dream was interrupted loudly by a\\ncall from the door: â\\x80\\x9cCome in wiâ\\x80\\x99 the boat; Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a message to gie ye for\\nthe pier,â\\x80\\x9d cried the farmer, at the top of his voice; and the country\\nboy started back to himself, and made a dash at his oars, and pulled\\ninshore as violently and unhandsomely as if the nature of his dreams had\\nbeen found out, and he was ashamed of himself. Colin forgot all the\\nsoftening influences of the scene, and all the fine thoughts that had,\\nunconscious to himself, come into his head, when he found that the\\ncommission his father meant to give him was that of rowing the\\nstranger-boy as far as the pier, which was about three miles farther\\ndown the loch. If disobedience had been an offence understood at Ramore,\\npossibly he might have refused; but neither boy nor man, however\\nwell-inclined, is likely to succeed in doing, the first time of trying,\\na kind of sin with which he has no acquaintance. To give Colin justice,\\nhe did his best, and showed a cordial inclination to make himself\\ndisagreeable. He came in so clumsily that the boat grounded a yard or\\ntwo off shore, and would not by any coaxing be persuaded to approach\\nnearer. And when young Frankland, much to his amazement, leapt on board\\nwithout wetting his feet, as the country lad maliciously intended, and\\ncame against Colin with such force as almost to knock him down, the\\nyoung boatman thrust his passenger forward very rudely, and was as near\\ncapsizing the boat as pride would permit him. â\\x80\\x9cSit forrit in the stern,\\nsit forrit. Were ye never in a boat afore, that ye think I can row and\\nyou sitting there?â\\x80\\x9d said the unchristian Colin, bringing one of the oars\\nheavily against his adversaryâ\\x80\\x99s shins.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat the deuce do you mean by that? Give me the oar! We donâ\\x80\\x99t row like\\nthat on the Thames, I can tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger; and the brief\\nskirmish between them for the possession of the oar having terminated\\nabruptly by the intervention of Colin the elder, who was still within\\nhearing, the two boys set off, sullenly enough, down the loch. The\\nrainbow was dying off by this time, the clouds rolling out again over\\nthe hills; and the celestial pillars and heavenly archways had no\\nlonger, as may be supposed, since this rude invasion of the real and\\ndisagreeable, the least remnant of ground to stand upon in the thoughts\\nof young Colin of Ramore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYe saw the young gentleman safe to the pier? Heâ\\x80\\x99s a bonnie lad, though\\nmaybe no as weel-mannered as ane would like to see,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeep me! such a way to name his father--Bairns maun be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 neglected\\nin such a grand house--aye left wiâ\\x80\\x99 servants, and never trained to trust\\ntheir bits of secrets to father or mother. Laddies,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwife, with a little solemnity, looking across the sleeping baby upon the\\nfour heads of different sizes which bent over their supper at the table\\nbefore her, â\\x80\\x9cmind you aye, that, right or wrong, them thatâ\\x80\\x99s maist\\ninterested in whatever befalls you is them that belongs to you--maist\\nready to praise if yeâ\\x80\\x99ve done weel, and excuse you if yeâ\\x80\\x99ve done wrang.\\nI hope you were civil to the strange callant, Colin, my man?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay,â\\x80\\x9d said young Colin, not without a movement of conscience; but he\\ndid not think it necessary to enter into details.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen a callant like that is pridefuâ\\x80\\x99, and looks as if he thought\\nhimself better than other folk, I hope my laddies are no the ones to\\nmind,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress of Ramore. â\\x80\\x9cIt shows he hasna had the\\nadvantages that might have been expected. Itâ\\x80\\x99s nae harm to you, but a\\ngreat deal oâ\\x80\\x99 harm to him. Ye dinna ken how weel off you are, you boys,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the mother, making a little address to them as they sat over their\\nsupper; Little Johnnie, whose porridge was too hot for him, turned\\ntowards her the round, wondering black eyes, which beamed out like a\\npair of stray stars from his little freckled face, and through his wisps\\nof flaxen hair, bleached white by rain and sun; but the three others\\nwent on very steadily with their supper, and did not disturb themselves;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s aye your father at hand ready to tell ye whatever you want to\\nken--no like yon poor callant, that would have to gang to a tutor, or a\\nservant, or something worse; no that heâ\\x80\\x99s an ill laddie; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m aye\\nkeen to see ye behave yoursels like gentlemen, and yon wasna ony great\\nspecimen, as it was very easy to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter this there was a pause, for none of the boys were disposed to\\nenter into that topic of conversation. After a little period of silence,\\nduring which the spoons made a diversion and filled up the vacancy, they\\nbegan to find their tongues again.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 wet up on the hill,â\\x80\\x9d said Archie, the second boy, â\\x80\\x9cand they\\nsay the glass is aye falling, and the corn on the Barnton fields has\\nbeen out this three weeks, and Dugald Macfarlane, he says itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsprouting--and oh, mother!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Archie?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe new minister came by when I was down at the smiddy with the brown\\nmare. You never saw such a red head. It is red enough to set the kirk on\\nfire. They were saying at the smiddy that naebody would stand such a\\ncolour of hair--itâ\\x80\\x99s waur than no preaching weel--and I said I thought\\nthat too,â\\x80\\x9d said the enterprising Archie; â\\x80\\x9cfor Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure I never mind ony\\noâ\\x80\\x99 the sermon, but I couldna forget such red hair.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I saw him too,â\\x80\\x9d said little Johnnie; â\\x80\\x9che clapped me on the head,\\nand said how was my mammaw; and I said we never caâ\\x80\\x99ed onybody mammaw,\\nbut just mother; and then he clapped me again, and said I was a good\\nboy. What for was I a good boy?â\\x80\\x9d said Johnnie, who was of an inquiring\\nand philosophical frame of mind, â\\x80\\x9cbecause I said we didna say mammaw? or\\njust because it was me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause heâ\\x80\\x99s a kind man, and has a kind thought for even the little\\nbairns,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, â\\x80\\x9cand it wasnaâ\\x80\\x99 like a boy oâ\\x80\\x99 mine to say an\\nidle word against him. Do you think they know better at the smiddy,\\nArchie, than here? Poor gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d said the good woman, â\\x80\\x9cto be aâ\\x80\\x99 this\\ntime wearyinâ\\x80\\x99 and waitinâ\\x80\\x99, and his heart yearninâ\\x80\\x99 within him to get a\\nkirk, and do his Masterâ\\x80\\x99s work; and then to haâ\\x80\\x99e a parcel of haverels\\nset up and make a faction against him because he has a red head. It\\nmakes ane think shame oâ\\x80\\x99 human nature and Scotch folk baith.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut he canna preach, mother,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, breaking silence almost for\\nthe first time; â\\x80\\x9cthe red head is only an excuse.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna like excuses,â\\x80\\x9d said his mother, â\\x80\\x9cand I never kent before that\\nyou were a judge oâ\\x80\\x99 preaching. You may come to ken better about it\\nyoursel before aâ\\x80\\x99 â\\x80\\x99s done. I canna but think thereâ\\x80\\x99s something wrang\\nwhen the like oâ\\x80\\x99 that can be,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s studied, and\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s learned Latin and Greek, and found out aâ\\x80\\x99 the ill that can be said\\nabout Scripture, and aâ\\x80\\x99 the lies that ever have been invented against\\nthe truth; and heâ\\x80\\x99s been brought up to be a minister aâ\\x80\\x99 his days, and\\nknows whatâ\\x80\\x99s expected. But as soon as word gangs about that the Earl has\\npromised him our kirk, thereâ\\x80\\x99s opposition raised. Noâ\\x80\\x99 that onybody kens\\nony ill of him; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s the smith, and the wright, and Thomas Scott\\noâ\\x80\\x99 Lintwearie, maun lay their heads thegether--and first they say he\\ncanna preach, and then that heâ\\x80\\x99ll noâ\\x80\\x99 visit, and at least, if aâ\\x80\\x99thing\\nelse fails, that he has a red head. If it was a new doctor that was\\ncoming, wha would be heeding about the colour oâ\\x80\\x99 his hair? but itâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nminister thatâ\\x80\\x99s to stand by our deathbeds, and baptize our bairns, and\\nguide us in the right way: and weâ\\x80\\x99re no to let him come in peace, or sit\\ndown in comfort. If we canna keep him from getting the kirk, we can make\\nhim miserable when he does get it. Eh, bairns; I think shame! and Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nnoâ\\x80\\x99 so sure as I am in maist things,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, looking up\\nwith a consciousness of her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s presence, â\\x80\\x9cthat the maister\\nhimsel--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, Iâ\\x80\\x99m aye for popular rights,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin of Ramore. He had just\\ncome in, and had been standing behind taking off his big coat, on which\\nthe rain glistened, and listening to all that his wife said. â\\x80\\x9cBut if\\nColin was a man and a minister,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer with a gleam of humour,\\nas he drew his chair towards the fire, â\\x80\\x9cand had to fight his way to a\\nkirk like aâ\\x80\\x99 the young men now-a-days, I wouldna say I would like it.\\nThey might object to his big mouth; and youâ\\x80\\x99ve ower muckle a mouth\\nyourselâ\\x80\\x99, Jeanie,â\\x80\\x9d continued big Colin, looking admiringly at the comely\\nmother of his boys. â\\x80\\x9cI might tell them wha he took it from, and that if\\nhe had as grand a flow of language as his mother, there would be nae\\nfear oâ\\x80\\x99 him. As for the red head, the Earl himselâ\\x80\\x99s a grand example, and\\nif red hairâ\\x80\\x99s right in an earl it canna be immoral in a minister; but\\nJeanie, though youâ\\x80\\x99re an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 revolutionary, ye maunna meddle with the\\nkirk, nor take away popular rights.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no gaun to be led into an argument,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, with a\\nslightly vexed expression; â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m far from sure about the kirk. After\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve opposed the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s coming in, and held committees upon him,\\nand offered objections, and done your best to worry the life out oâ\\x80\\x99 him,\\nand make him disgusted baith at himselâ\\x80\\x99 and you, do you think after that\\nye can attend to him when youâ\\x80\\x99re weel, and send for him when youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nsick, wiâ\\x80\\x99 the right feelings? But Iâ\\x80\\x99m no gaun to speak ony mair about\\nthe minister. Is the corn in yet, Colin, from the East Park? Eh, bless\\nme! and it was cut before this wean was born?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll have but a poor harvest after aâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ndisappointment, but it canna be helpit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s strange how something aye\\ncomes in, to keep a man down when he thinks heâ\\x80\\x99s to have a bit margin;\\nbut we must jog on, Jeanie, my woman. As long as we have bread to eat,\\nlet us be thankful. And as for Colin, it needna make ony difference.\\nGlasgowâ\\x80\\x99s no so far off, but he can still get his parritch out of the\\nfamily meal; and as long as heâ\\x80\\x99s careful and diligent weâ\\x80\\x99ll try and fend\\nfor him. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard work getting bread out of our hillside,â\\x80\\x9d said big\\nColin; â\\x80\\x9cbut ye may have a different life from your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, lad, if you\\ntake heed to the opportunities in your hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAâ\\x80\\x99 the opportunities in the world,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin the younger, in a burst,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwouldna give me a chance like yon English fellow. Everything comes\\nready to him. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no fair. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to make up wiâ\\x80\\x99 him first, and then\\nbeat him--and so I would,â\\x80\\x9d said the boy, with a glow on his face, and a\\nhappy unconsciousness of contradicting himself, â\\x80\\x9cif I had the chance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s just ane oâ\\x80\\x99 the things we have to count\\nupon in our way of living. Itâ\\x80\\x99s little credit to a man to be strong,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the farmer, stretching his great arms with a natural consciousness\\nof power, â\\x80\\x9cunless he has that to do that tries it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s harder work to\\nme, you may be sure, to get a pickle corn off the hillside, than for the\\nEnglish farmers down in yon callantâ\\x80\\x99s country to draw wheat and fatness\\nout oâ\\x80\\x99 their furrows. But I think myselâ\\x80\\x99 nane the worse a man,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Colin of Ramore, with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas, as the laddie caâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhim, gangs wading over the heather aâ\\x80\\x99 day after the grouse and the\\npaitricks; he thinks heâ\\x80\\x99s playing, himselâ\\x80\\x99, but heâ\\x80\\x99s as hard at work as\\nI am. Weâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 bluid relations, though the family likeness whiles lies\\ndeep and is hard to find. A man maun be fighting wiâ\\x80\\x99 something. If itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nno the dour earth that refuses him bread, itâ\\x80\\x99s the wet bog and the\\nheather that comes atween him and his sport, as he caâ\\x80\\x99s it. Never you\\nmind whaâ\\x80\\x99s before you on the road. Make up to him, Colin. Many a day\\nheâ\\x80\\x99ll stray out oâ\\x80\\x99 the path gathering straws to divert himselâ\\x80\\x99, when\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve naething to do but to push on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, but I wouldna like a laddie oâ\\x80\\x99 mine to think,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted his\\nmother, eagerly, â\\x80\\x9cthat thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae guid but getting on in the world.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll not have my bairns learn ony such lesson; laddies,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nfarmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, in all the solemnity of her innocence, â\\x80\\x9cmind you this\\naboon aâ\\x80\\x99. You might be princes the morn, and no as good men as your\\nfather. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae Sir Thomases, nor Earls, nor Lord Chancellors I ever\\nheard tell oâ\\x80\\x99, that was mair thought upon nor wiâ\\x80\\x99 better reason----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this moment Jess entered from the kitchen, to suggest that it was\\nbedtime.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd lang enough for the mistress to be sitting up, and she so\\ndelicate,â\\x80\\x9d said the sole servant of the house. â\\x80\\x9cIf ye had been in your\\nain room wiâ\\x80\\x99 a fire and a book to read, it would have been wiser-like,\\nthan among aâ\\x80\\x99 thae noisy laddies, wiâ\\x80\\x99 the wean and a seam as if ye were\\nas strong as me. Maister, I wish you would speak to Colin; heâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nmasterfuâ\\x80\\x99; instead of gaun to his bed, like a civilized lad, yonder he\\nis awaâ\\x80\\x99 ben to the kitchen and down by the fire to read his book, till\\nhis hairâ\\x80\\x99s like a singed sheepâ\\x80\\x99s-head, and his cheeks like burning\\npeats. Ane canna do a handâ\\x80\\x99s-turn wiâ\\x80\\x99 a parcel oâ\\x80\\x99 callants about the\\nplace day and nicht,â\\x80\\x9d said Jess, in an aggrieved tone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd just when Archie Candlish has suppered his horses and come in for\\nhalf an hourâ\\x80\\x99s crack,â\\x80\\x9d said the master. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll send Colin to his bed; but\\ndinna have ower muckle to say to Archie, heâ\\x80\\x99s a rover,â\\x80\\x9d continued the\\ngood-tempered farmer, who â\\x80\\x9cmade allowancesâ\\x80\\x9d for a little love-making. He\\nraised himself out of his arm-chair with a little hesitation, like a\\ngreat mastiff uncoiling itself out of a position of comfort, and went\\nslowly away as he spoke, moving off through the dimly-lighted room like\\nan amiable giant as he was.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, keep me!--and Archie Candlish had just that very minute lookit in\\nat the door,â\\x80\\x9d said Jess, lifting her apron to her cheeks, which were\\nglowing with blushes and laughter. â\\x80\\x9cNo that I wanted him; but he came in\\nwiâ\\x80\\x99 the news aboot the new minister, and noo Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never hear an end oâ\\x80\\x99t,\\nand the maister will think heâ\\x80\\x99s aye there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf heâ\\x80\\x99s a decent lad and means weel, its nae great matter,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nmistress; â\\x80\\x9cbut I dinna approve of ower mony lads. Ye may gang through\\nthe wood and through the wood and take but a crooked stick at the end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s naebody I ken oâ\\x80\\x99 that the mistress can mean, but Bowed Jacob,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Jess reflectively, â\\x80\\x9cand are might do waur than take him though heâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnae great figure of a man. The siller that body makes is a miracle, and\\nit would be grand to live in a twa-storied house, and keep a lass; but\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 Establishment man, and he micht interfere wiâ\\x80\\x99 my\\nconvictions,â\\x80\\x9d said the young woman with a glimmer of humour which found\\nno response in the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s serious eyes; for Mrs. Campbell, being of\\na poetical and imaginative temperament, took most things much in\\nearnest, and was slow to perceive a joke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shouldna speak about convictions in that light way, Jess,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nfarmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. â\\x80\\x9cI wouldna meddle wiâ\\x80\\x99 them myselâ\\x80\\x99, no for aâ\\x80\\x99 the wealth\\noâ\\x80\\x99 the parish; but though the maister and me are strong Kirk folk, ye\\nken ye never were molested here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo hear Archie Candlish about the new minister!â\\x80\\x9d cried Jess, whose\\nquick ear had already ascertained that her master had paused in the\\nkitchen to speak to her visitor, â\\x80\\x9cye would laugh; but though itâ\\x80\\x99s grand\\nfun for the folk, maybe itâ\\x80\\x99s no so pleasant for the poor man. We put\\ndown our names for the man we like best, us Free Kirk folk, but itâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndifferent in the parish. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s Tammas Scott, he vows heâ\\x80\\x99ll object to\\nevery presentee the Earl puts in. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no heeding for the Earl,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nJesse; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s a dour tory and can fecht for himselâ\\x80\\x99; but eh I wouldna be\\nthat poor minister set up there for aâ\\x80\\x99 the parish to object to. Iâ\\x80\\x99d\\nrather work at a weaverâ\\x80\\x99s loom or sell herrings about the country-side,\\nif it was me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, weel, things that are hard for the flesh are guid for the\\nspirit--or at least folk say so,â\\x80\\x9d cried the mistress of Ramore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna believe in that for my part,â\\x80\\x9d said the energetic Jess, as she\\nlifted the wooden cradle in her strong arms. â\\x80\\x9cLeave the wean still,\\nmistress, and draw your shawl about ye. I could carry you too, for that\\nmatter. Eh me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no oâ\\x80\\x99 that way oâ\\x80\\x99 thinking; when yeâ\\x80\\x99re happy and weel\\nlikit, yeâ\\x80\\x99re aye good in proportion. No to gang against the words oâ\\x80\\x99\\nScripture,â\\x80\\x9d said Jess, setting down the big cradle with a bump in her\\nmistressâ\\x80\\x99s bedroom, and looking anxiously at the sleeping baby, which\\nwith a little start and gape, resisted this attempt to break its\\nslumbers; â\\x80\\x9cbut eh, mistress, itâ\\x80\\x99s aye my opinion that the happier folk\\nare the better they are. I never was as happy as in this house,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued the grateful handmaiden, furtively pursuing a tear into the\\ncorner of her eye, with a large forefinger, â\\x80\\x9cno that Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning to say\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m guid; but yet--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou might be waur,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ve aye a kind\\nheart and a blythe look, and that gangs a far way wiâ\\x80\\x99 the maister and\\nme. But itâ\\x80\\x99s time Archie Candlish was hame to his mother. When thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnae moon and such heavy roads, you shouldna bring a decent man three\\nmile out of his way at this hour oâ\\x80\\x99 the nicht to see you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe? as if _I_ was wanting him,â\\x80\\x9d said Jess, â\\x80\\x9cand him no a word to say to\\nme or ony lass, but about the beasts and the new minister. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be back\\nin half a minute; I wouldna waste my time upon a gomeril like you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhile Jess sallied forth through the chilly passages to which the\\nweeping atmosphere had communicated a sensation of universal damp, the\\nmistress knelt down to arrange her infant more commodiously in its\\nhomely nest. The red firelight made harmless glimmers all over her\\nfigure, catching now and then a sidelong glance out of her eyes as she\\nsmoothed the little pillow, and laid the tiny coverlet over the small\\nunconscious creature wrapt closely in webs and bands of sleep. When she\\nhad done, she still knelt watching it as mothers will, with a smile upon\\nher face. After a while the beaming soft dark eyes turned to the light\\nwith a natural attraction, to the glimmers of the fire shooting\\naccidental rays into all the corners, and to the steady little candle on\\nthe mantel-shelf. The mistress looked round on all the familiar objects\\nof the homely low-roofed chamber. Outside, the rain fell heavily still\\nupon the damp and sodden country, soaking silently in the dark into the\\nforlorn wheat-sheaves, which had been standing in the fields to dry in\\nineffectual hopefulness for past weeks. Matters did not look promising\\non the farm of Ramore, and nothing had occurred to add any particular\\nhappiness to its mistressâ\\x80\\x99s lot. But happiness is perverse and follows\\nno rule, and Jessâ\\x80\\x99s sentiment found an echo in Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s mind. As\\nshe knelt by the cradle, her heart suddenly swelled with a consciousness\\nof the perfection of life and joy in her and around her. It was in\\nhomely words enough that she gave it expression--â\\x80\\x9cAâ\\x80\\x99 weel, and under ae\\nroof,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself with exquisite dews of thankfulness in her\\neyes. â\\x80\\x9cAnd the Lord have pity on lone folk and sorrowful,â\\x80\\x9d added the\\ntender woman, with a compassion beyond words, a yearning that all might\\nbe glad like herself; the pity of happiness, which is of all pity, the\\nmost divine. Her boys were saying abrupt prayers, one by one, as they\\nsank in succession into dreamless slumber. The master had gone out in\\nthe rain to take one last look over his kyne and his farmyard, and see\\nthat all was safe for the night, and Archie Candlish had just been\\ndismissed with a stinging jest from the kitchen door, which Jess bolted\\nand barred with cheerful din, singing softly to herself as she went\\nabout the house putting up the innocent shutters, which could not have\\nresisted the first touch of a skilful hand. The rain was falling all\\nover the wet silent country; the Holy Loch gleamed like a kind of\\ntwilight spot in the darkness, and the house of Ramore stood shut up and\\nhushed, no light at all to be seen but that from the open door, which\\nthe farmer suddenly extinguished as he came in. But when that solitary\\nlight died out from the invisible hillside, and the darkness and the\\nrain and the whispering night took undisturbed possession, was just the\\nmoment when the mother within, kneeling over her cradle in the\\nfirelight, was surprised by that sudden conscious touch of\\nhappiness.--â\\x80\\x9cHappiness? oh, ay, weel enough; weâ\\x80\\x99ve a great deal to be\\nthankfuâ\\x80\\x99 for,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, with a little sleepy surprise; â\\x80\\x9cif it\\nwerna for the sprouting corn and the broken weather; but I dinna see\\nonything particular to be happy about at this minute, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m gaun to my\\nbed.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor the prose and the poetry did not exactly understand each other at\\nall times, even in the primitive farm-house of Ramore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n\\nThe internal economy of a Scotch parish is not so clearly comprehensible\\nnow-a-days as it was in former times. Civilization itself has made\\ncountless inroads upon the original unities everywhere, and the changes\\nthat have come to pass within the recollection of the living generation\\nare almost as great though very different from those which made Scotland\\nduring last century so picturesque in its state of transition. When\\nSunday morning dawned upon the Holy Loch, it did not shine upon that\\npretty rural picture of unanimous church-going so well-known to the\\nhistory of the past. The groups from the cottages took different\\nways--the carriage from the Castle swept round the hill to the other\\nside of the parish, where there was an â\\x80\\x9cEnglish Chapel.â\\x80\\x9d The reign of\\nopinion and liking was established in the once primitive community. Half\\nof the people ascended the hillside to the Free Church, while the others\\nwound down the side of the loch to the Kirk, which had once accommodated\\nthe whole parish. This state of affairs had become so usual that even\\npolemical feeling had ceased to a great extent, and the two streams of\\nchurch-going people crossed each other placidly without recriminations.\\nThis day, for a wonder, the sun was shining brightly, notwithstanding a\\ncloudy stormy sky, which now and then heaved forward a rolling mass of\\nvapour, and dispersed it sharply over the hills in a flying mist and\\nshower.\\n\\nThe parish church lay at the lower end of the loch, a pretty little\\nchurch built since the days when architecture had penetrated even into\\nScotland. Colin of Ramore and his family were there in their pew, the\\nboys arranged in order of seniority between Mrs. Campbell, who sat at\\nthe head, and the farmer himself who kept the seat at the door.\\nBlack-eyed Johnnie, with his hair bleached white by constant exposure,\\nand his round eyes wandering over the walls and the pews and the pulpit\\nand the people, sat by his motherâ\\x80\\x99s side, and the younger Colin occupied\\nhis post of seniority by his father. They were all seated, in this\\ndisposition, when the present occupant of the Castle, Sir Thomas\\nFrankland, lounged up the little aisle, with his son after him. Sir\\nThomas was quite devout and respectable, a man who knew how to conduct\\nhimself even in such a novel scene--and after all a Presbyterian church\\nwas no novelty to the sportsman--but to Harry the aspect of everything\\nwas new, and his curiosity was excited. It was a critical moment in the\\nhistory of the parish. The former minister had been transferred only a\\nfew weeks before to a more important station, and the Earl, the patron,\\nhad, according to Scotch phraseology, â\\x80\\x9cpresentedâ\\x80\\x9d a new incumbent to the\\nliving. This unhappy man was ascending the pulpit when the Franklands,\\nfather and son, entered the church. For the Earlâ\\x80\\x99s presentation by no\\nmeans implied the peaceable entrance of the new minister; he had to\\npreach, to give the people an opportunity of deciding whether they liked\\nhim or not; and if they did not like him, they had the power of\\nâ\\x80\\x9cobjecting,â\\x80\\x9d that is, of urging special reasons for their dislike before\\nthe Presbytery, with a certainty of making a little noise in the\\ndistrict, and a reasonable probability of disgusting and mortifying the\\nunlucky presentee, to the point of throwing up his appointment. All this\\nwas well known to the unfortunate man, who rose up in the pulpit as Sir\\nThomas found a seat, and proceeded to read the psalm with a somewhat\\nembarrassed and faltering voice. He was moderately young and\\nwell-looking, with a face, at the present moment, more agitated than was\\nquite harmonious with the position in which he stood: for he was quite\\naware that everybody was criticizing him, and that the inflections of\\nhis voice and the fiery tint of his hair were being noted by eager\\ncommentators bent upon finding ground for an â\\x80\\x9cobjectionâ\\x80\\x9d in everything\\nhe said. Such a consciousness naturally does not promote ease or\\ncomfort. His hair looked redder than ever, as a stray ray of sunshine\\ngleamed in upon him, and his voice took a nervous break as he looked\\nover the many hard unsympathetic faces which were regarding him with the\\nsharp curiosity and inspection of excited wits.\\n\\nBut while Harry Frankland made, as he thought, â\\x80\\x9can ass of himselfâ\\x80\\x9d on\\nevery occasion that offered--standing bolt upright when the congregation\\nbegan to sing, which they did at their leisure, seated in the usual\\nway--and kicking his heels in an attempt to kneel when everybody round\\nhim rose up for the prayer, and feeling terribly red and ashamed at each\\nmistake, Colin the younger, of Ramore, occupied himself, like a\\nheartless young critic as he was, in making observations on the\\nminister. Colin, like his father, had a high opinion of â\\x80\\x9cpopular\\nrights.â\\x80\\x9d It was his idea, somehow drawn in with the damp Highland air he\\nbreathed, that the right of objecting to a presentee was one of the most\\nimportant privileges of a Scotch Churchman. Then, he was to be a\\nminister himself, and the consciousness of this fact intensified the\\nnatural opposition which prompted the boyâ\\x80\\x99s mind to resist anything and\\neverything that threatened to be imposed on him. Colin even listened to\\nthe prayer, which was a thing not usual with him, that he might find out\\nthe objectionable phrases. And to be sure there were plenty of\\nobjectionable phrases to mar the real devotion; the vainest of vain\\nrepetitions, well-known and familiar as household words to every Scotch\\near, demonstrated how little effect the absence of a liturgy has in\\npromoting fervent and individual supplications. The congregation in\\ngeneral listened, like young Colin, standing up in easy attitudes, and\\nobserving everything that passed around them with open-eyed composure.\\nIt did not look much like common supplication, nor did it pretend to\\nbe--for the people were but _listening_ to the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s prayer, which,\\nto tell the truth, contained various expository and remonstrative\\nparagraphs, which were clearly addressed to the congregation; and they\\nwere all very glad to sit down when it was over, and clear their\\nthroats, and prepare for the sermon, which was the real business of the\\nday.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna like aâ\\x80\\x99 that new-fangled nonsense to begin with,â\\x80\\x9d said Eben\\nCampbell, of Barnton, as he walked home after church, with the party\\nfrom Ramore; â\\x80\\x9cnaebody wants twa chapters read at one diet of worship.\\nThe Bibleâ\\x80\\x99s grand at hame, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no what a man gangs to the kirk\\nfor; that, and so mony prayers--itâ\\x80\\x99s naething but a great offput of\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut we never can have ower muckle oâ\\x80\\x99 the word of God,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin of\\nRamoreâ\\x80\\x99s wife.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m of Ebenâ\\x80\\x99s opinion,â\\x80\\x9d said another neighbour. â\\x80\\x9cWe have the word oâ\\x80\\x99\\nGod at hame, and I hope we make a good use oâ\\x80\\x99 it; but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no what we\\ngang to the kirk to hear. When ye see a man thatâ\\x80\\x99s set up in the pulpit\\nfor anither purpose aâ\\x80\\x99thegether, spending half his time in reading\\nchapters and ither preliminaries, I aye consider itâ\\x80\\x99s a sure sign that\\nhe hasna muckle oâ\\x80\\x99 his ain to say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey were all walking abreast in a leisurely Sunday fashion up the loch;\\nthe children roaming about the skirts of the older party, some in front\\nand some behind, occasionally making furtive investigations into the\\ncondition of the brambles, an anti-Sabbatical occupation which was\\nsharply interrupted when found out--the women picking their steps along\\nthe edges of the muddy road, with now and then a word of pleasant\\ngossip, while the men trudged on sturdily through the puddles,\\ndiscussing the great subject of the day.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSome of the new folk from the Castle were in the kirk to-day,â\\x80\\x9d said one\\nof the party,--â\\x80\\x9cwhich is a respect to the parish the Earl doesna pay\\nhimself. Things are terrible changed in that way since my young days.\\nThe auld Earl, this aneâ\\x80\\x99s father, was an elder in the Kirk; and gentle\\nand simple, we aâ\\x80\\x99 said our prayers thegether--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna approve of that expression,â\\x80\\x9d said Eben of Barnton. â\\x80\\x9cTo speak of\\nsaying your prayers in the kirk is pure papistry. Say your prayers at\\nhame, as I hope we aâ\\x80\\x99 do, at the family altar, no to speak of private\\ndevotions,â\\x80\\x9d said this defender of the faith, with a glance at the\\nunlucky individual who had just spoken, and who was understood not to be\\nso regular in the article of family prayer as he ought to have been. â\\x80\\x9cWe\\ngang to the kirk to have our minds stirred up and put in remembrance. I\\ndinna approve of the English fashion of putting everything into the\\nprayers.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, weel, I meant nae harm,â\\x80\\x9d said the previous speaker. â\\x80\\x9cWe aâ\\x80\\x99 gaed\\nto the Kirk, was what I meant to say; and thereâ\\x80\\x99s the Queen, she aye\\nsets a grand example. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll no find her driving off three or four miles\\nto an English Chapel. I consider itâ\\x80\\x99s a great respect to the parish to\\nsee Sir Thomas in the Castle pew.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would rather see him respect the Sabbath day,â\\x80\\x9d said Eben Campbell,\\npointing out a little pleasure-boat, a tiny little cockleshell, with a\\nmorsel of snow-white sail, which just then appeared in the middle of the\\nloch, rushing up beautifully before the wind, through the placid waters,\\nand lighting up the landscape with a touch of life and motion. Young\\nColin was at Ebenâ\\x80\\x99s elbow, and followed the movement of his hand with\\nkeen eyes. A spark of jealousy had kindled in the boyâ\\x80\\x99s breast--he could\\nnot have told why. He was not so horrified as he ought to have been at\\nthe sight of the boat disturbing the Sunday quiet; but, with a swell of\\nindignation and resentment in his boyish heart, he thought of the\\ndifference between himself and the young visitor at the Castle. It\\nlooked symbolical to Colin. He, trudging heavily over the muddy, lengthy\\nroad; the other, flying along in that dainty, little, bird-like boat,\\nwith those white wings of sail, which pleased Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eye in spite of\\nhimself, carrying him on as lightly and swiftly as heart could desire.\\nWhy should one boy have such a wonderful advantage over another? It was\\nthe first grand problem which had puzzled and embittered Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nthoughts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere they go!â\\x80\\x9d said the boy. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s fine and easy, running like that\\nbefore the wind. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ll get to the end oâ\\x80\\x99 the loch before weâ\\x80\\x99ve got\\nover a mile. That makes an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 difference,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with subdued\\nwrath; he was thinking of other things besides the long walk from church\\nand the muddy road.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ll may be get home as soon, for all that,â\\x80\\x9d said his father, who\\nguessed the boyâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts; for the elder Colinâ\\x80\\x99s experienced eye had\\nalready seen that mists were rising among the hills, and that the fair\\nbreeze would soon be fair no longer. The scene changed as if by\\nenchantment while the farmer spoke. Such changes come and go like breath\\nover the Holy Loch. The sunshine which had been making the whole\\nlandscape into a visible paradise, vanished suddenly off the hills and\\nwaters like a frightened thing, and a visible darkness came brooding\\nover the mountains, dropping lower every moment like a pall of gloom\\nover the lower banks and the suddenly paled and shivering loch. The\\njoyous little boat, which had been careering on as if by a natural\\nimpulse of delight, suddenly changed its character along with all the\\nother details of the picture. The spectators saw its white sail,\\nfluttering like an alarmed seabird, against the black background of\\ncloud. Then it began to tack and waver and make awkward tremulous darts\\nacross the darkened water. The party of pedestrians stood still to watch\\nit, as the position became dangerous. They knew the loch and the winds\\ntoo well to look on with composure. As for young Colin of Ramore, his\\nheart began to leap and swell in his boyish bosom. Was that his\\nadversary, the favoured rival whom he had recognised by instinct, who\\nwas fighting for his life out there in midwater, with the storm gaining\\non him, and his little vessel staggering in the wind? Colin did not hear\\nthe remarks of the other spectators. He felt in his heart that he was\\nlooking on at a struggle which was for life or death, and his contempt\\nfor the skill of the amateur sailor, whose unused hands were so\\nmanifestly unable to manage the boat, was mingled with a kind of despair\\nlest a stronger power should snatch this opponent of his own out of the\\nfuture strife, in which Colin had vowed to himself to be victorious.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou fool! take in the sail,â\\x80\\x9d he shouted, putting both his hands to his\\nmouth, forgetting how impossible it was that the sound could reach; and\\nthen scarcely knowing what he was about, the boy rushed down to the\\nbeach, and jumped into the nearest boat. The sound of his oars furiously\\nplashing through the silence was the first indication to his companions\\nof what he had done. And he did not even see nor hear the calls and\\ngestures with which he was summoned back again. His oars, and how to\\nget there at a flight like a bird, occupied his mind entirely. Yet even\\nin his anxiety he scorned to ask for help which would have carried him\\nso much sooner to the spot he aimed at. As this sudden sound echoed\\nthrough the profound silence, various outcries came from the group on\\nthe bank.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s tempting Providence,â\\x80\\x9d cried Eben Campbell. â\\x80\\x9cYonâ\\x80\\x99s a judgment on\\nthe Sabbath-breaker,--and what can the laddie do? Come back, sir, this\\nmoment, come back! Yeâ\\x80\\x99ll never win there in time.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs for the boyâ\\x80\\x99s mother, after his first start she clasped her hands\\ntogether, and watched the boat with an interest too intense for words.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s in nae danger,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself softly; and it would have been\\nhard to tell whether she was sorry or glad that her boyâ\\x80\\x99s enterprise was\\nattended by no personal peril.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet him be,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer of Ramore, pushing aside his anxious\\nneighbour, who was calling Colin ineffectually but without intermission.\\nColin Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s face had taken a sudden crimson flush which nobody\\ncould account for. He went off up the beach with heavy rapid steps,\\nscattering the shingle round his feet, to a spot exactly opposite the\\nstruggling boat, and stood there watching with wonderful eagerness. The\\nlittle white sail was still fluttering and struggling like a distressed\\nbird upon the black overclouded water. Now it lurched over till the very\\nmast seemed to touch the loch--now recovered itself for a tremulous\\nmoment--and finally, shivering like a living creature, gave one wild\\nsudden stagger, and disappeared. When the speck of white vanished out of\\nthe black landscape, a cry came out of all their hearts; and hopeless as\\nit was, the very man who had been calling Colin back, rushed in his turn\\nto a boat, and pushed off violently into the loch. The women stood\\nhuddled together, helpless with terror and grief. â\\x80\\x9cThe bit laddie! the\\nbit laddie!â\\x80\\x9d cried one of them--â\\x80\\x9csome poor womanâ\\x80\\x99s bairn.â\\x80\\x9d As for Mrs.\\nCampbell, the world grew dark round her as she strained her eyes after\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s boat. She did not faint, for such was not the habit of the Holy\\nLoch; but she sank down suddenly on the wet green bank, and put up her\\nhand over her eyes as if to shade them from some imaginary sunshine, and\\ngazed, not seeing anything, after her boy. To see her, delicate as she\\nwas, with the woman weakness which they all understood, seating herself\\nin this wild way on the wet bank, distracted the attention of her kindly\\nfemale neighbours, even from the terrible event which had just taken\\nplace before their eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe the lad can swim,â\\x80\\x9d said Eben Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s wife--â\\x80\\x9conyway yonderâ\\x80\\x99s\\nyour Colin running races with death to save him. But you maunna sit\\nhere--come into Dugald Macfarlaneâ\\x80\\x99s house. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s my man away in\\nanother boat and some mair. But we canna let you sit here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, my Colin, I canna see my Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress of Ramore; but\\nthey led her away into the nearest cottage, notwithstanding her\\nreluctance. There they all stood clustering at the window, aiding the\\neyes which had failed her in her weakness. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother sat silent in\\nthe chair where they had placed her, trembling and rocking herself to\\nand fro. Her heart within her was praying and crying for the boys--the\\ntwo boys whom in this moment of confused anxiety she could not\\nseparate--her own first-born, and the stranger who was â\\x80\\x9canother womanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbairn.â\\x80\\x9d God help all women and mothers!--though Colin was safe, what\\ncould her heart do but break at the thought of the sudden calamity which\\nhad shut out the sunshine from another. She rocked herself to and fro,\\nceasing at last to hear what they said to her, and scarcely aware of\\nanything except the dull clank of the oars against the boatâ\\x80\\x99s side;\\nsomebody coming or going, she knew not which--always coming or\\ngoing--never bringing certain news which was lost and which saved.\\n\\nThe mistress of Ramore was still in this stupor of anxiety, when young\\nHarry Frankland, dripping and all but insensible, was carried into\\nDugald Macfarlaneâ\\x80\\x99s cottage. The little room became dark instantly with\\nsuch a cloud of men that it was difficult to make out how he had been\\nsaved, or if there was indeed any life left in the lad. But Dugald\\nMacfarlaneâ\\x80\\x99s wife, who had the ferry-boat at Struan, and understood\\nabout drowning, had bestirred herself in the meantime, and had hot\\nblankets and other necessaries in the inner room where big Colin\\nCampbell carried the boy. Then all the men about burst at once into the\\nnarrative. â\\x80\\x9cIf it hadna been for little Colin oâ\\x80\\x99 Ramoreâ\\x80\\x9d--was about all\\nMrs. Campbell made out of the tale. The cottage was so thronged that\\nthere was scarcely an entrance left for the doctor and Sir Thomas who\\nhad both been summoned by anxious messengers. By this time the storm had\\ncome down upon the loch, and a wild sudden tempest of rain was sweeping\\nblack across hill and water, obliterating every line of the landscape.\\nHalf-way across, playing on the surface of the water was a bit of spar\\nwith a scarlet rag attached to it, which made a great show glistening\\nover the black waves. This was all that was visible of the pleasure-boat\\nin which the young stranger had been bounding along so pleasantly an\\nhour before. The neighbours dropped off gradually, dispersing to other\\nadjacent houses to talk over the incident, or pushing homeward with an\\nindifference to the storm that was natural to the dwellers on the Holy\\nLoch; and it was only when she was left alone, waiting for her husband,\\nwho was in the inner room with Sir Thomas and the saved boy, that Mrs.\\nCampbell perceived Colinâ\\x80\\x99s bashful face gleaming in furtively at the\\nopen door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no so wet as it was; come away, mother, now,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnae fears oâ\\x80\\x99 _him_?â\\x80\\x9d And the lad pointed half with an assertion, half\\nwith an inquiry, towards the inner room. It was an unlucky moment for\\nthe shy hero, for just then big Colin of Ramore appeared with Sir Thomas\\nat the door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is the boy that saved my son,â\\x80\\x9d said Harryâ\\x80\\x99s father. â\\x80\\x9cYou are a\\nbrave fellow; neither he nor I will ever forget it. Let me know if there\\nis anything I can serve you in, and to the best of my power I will help\\nyou as you have helped me. What does he say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI say,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin the younger, with fierce blushes, â\\x80\\x9cthat it wasna me.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve done naething to be thanked for. Yon fellow swims like a fish, and\\nhe saved himsel.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then there came an answering voice from the inner room--a boyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nvoice subdued out of its natural falsetto into feminine tones of\\nweakness, â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s telling a lie, that fellow there,â\\x80\\x9d cried the other from\\nhis bed; â\\x80\\x9che picked me up when I was about done for. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll fight him if\\nhe likes as soon as Iâ\\x80\\x99m able. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s a lie he tells you; thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhim--that Campbell fellow there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which young Colin of Ramore clenched his fists in his wet pockets\\nand faced towards the door, which Dugald Macfarlaneâ\\x80\\x99s wife closed\\nsoftly, looking out upon him, shaking her head and holding up a finger\\nto impose silence; the two fathers meanwhile looked in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfaces. The English baronet and the Scotch farmer both broke into a low,\\nunsteady laugh, and then with an impulse of fellowship, mutually\\nextended their hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have nae reason to think shame of our sons,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin Campbell\\nwith his Scotch dignity; â\\x80\\x9cas for service or reward that is neither here\\nnor there; what my boy did your boy would do if he had the chance, and\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s nae mair to be said that I can see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a great deal more to be said,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas; â\\x80\\x9cLady Frankland\\nwill call on Mrs. Campbell, and thank that brave boy of yours; and if\\nyou think I can forget such a service,--I tell you thereâ\\x80\\x99s a great deal\\nmore to be said,â\\x80\\x9d said the sportsman, breaking down suddenly with a\\nlittle effusion, of which he was half ashamed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s right, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress of Ramore. â\\x80\\x9cGod be\\nthanked for the two laddies! My heart was breaking for the English lady.\\nGod be thanked! Thatâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 there is to say. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be real glad to see\\nthat open-hearted callant when heâ\\x80\\x99s well, and his mother too,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nfarmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, turning her soft eyes upon Sir Thomas, with a gracious\\nresponse to the overflowing of his heart. Sir Thomas took off his hat to\\nher as respectfully as he would have done to the Queen, when she took\\nher husbandâ\\x80\\x99s strong arm, and followed Colin, who by this time, with his\\nhands in his pockets and his heart beating loudly, was half way to\\nRamore; and now they had other topics besides that unfailing one of the\\nnew minister to talk of on the way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\n\\nNovember weather is not cheerful on the Holy Loch. The dazzling snow on\\nthe hills when there is sunshine, the sharp cold blue of the water, the\\nwithered ferns and heather on the banks, give it, it is true, a new tone\\nof colour unknown to its placid summer beauty; but, when there is no\\nsunshine, as is more usual, when the mountains are folded in dark mists,\\nand the rain falls cold, and the trees rain down a still heavier and\\nmore melancholy shower of perpetually falling leaves, there is little in\\nthe landscape to cheer the spirits of the inhabitants, who, fortunately\\nfor themselves, take it very calmly, like most people accustomed to such\\na climate. The farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife of Ramore, however, was not of that equable\\nmind. When she looked out from her homely parlour-window, it oppressed\\nher heart to miss her mountains, and to see the heavy atmosphere closing\\nin over her own little stretch of hill-side. She was busy, to be sure,\\nand had not much time to think of it; but, when she paused for a moment\\nin her many occupations, and looked wistfully for signs of â\\x80\\x9cclearing,â\\x80\\x9d\\nthe poetic soul in her homely bosom fell subdued into an unconscious\\nharmony with the heavy sky. If the baby looked pale by chance, the\\nmother took gloomy views of the matter on such days, and was subject to\\nlittle momentary failures of hope and courage, which amazed, and at the\\nsame time amused, big Colin, who by this time knew all about it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou were blythe enough about us aâ\\x80\\x99 yesterday, Jeanie,â\\x80\\x9d he would say\\nwith a smile, â\\x80\\x9cand nothingâ\\x80\\x99s happened to change the prospect but the\\nrain. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just as weel for the wean that the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s a dozen miles\\noff; for itâ\\x80\\x99s your eâ\\x80\\x99en that want physic, and a glint oâ\\x80\\x99 sunshine would\\nset aâ\\x80\\x99 right.â\\x80\\x9d He was standing by her, hovering like a great\\ngood-humoured cloud, his eyes dwelling upon her with that tender\\nperception of her sacred weakness, and admiring pride in her more\\ndelicate faculties, which are of the highest essence of love.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you dinna think me a fool altogether,â\\x80\\x9d the mistress would\\nanswer, with momentary offence; â\\x80\\x9cas if I was thinking of the rain, or as\\nif there was onything but rain to be lookit for! but when I mind that my\\nColin gangs away the morn--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then she took up her basket of mended stockings, and, with a little\\nimpatience, to hide a chance drop on her eyelash, carried them away to\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s room, where his chest stood open and was being packed for the\\njourney. It was not a very long journey, but it was the boyâ\\x80\\x99s first\\noutset into independent life; and very independent life was that which\\nawaited the country lad in Glasgow, where he was going to the\\nUniversity. On such a day dark shadows of many a melancholy story\\nfloated somehow upon the darkened atmosphere into Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf we could but have boarded him in a decent family,â\\x80\\x9d she said to\\nherself, as she packed her boyâ\\x80\\x99s stockings. But it had been â\\x80\\x9ca bad yearâ\\x80\\x9d\\nat Ramore, and no decent family would have received young Colin for so\\nsmall a sum as that on which he himself and various more wise advisers\\nconsidered it possible for him to live, by the help of an occasional\\nhamper of home produce, in a little lodging of his own. Mrs. Campbell\\nhad acceded to this arrangement as the best; but it occurred to her to\\nremember various wrecks she had encountered even in her innocent life;\\nand her heart failed her a little as she leaned over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s big â\\x80\\x9ckist.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin himself said very little on the subject, though he thought of\\nnothing else; but he was a taciturn Scotch boy, totally unused to\\ndisclose his feelings. He was strolling round and round the place with\\nhis hands in his pockets, gradually getting soaked by the persistent\\nrain, and rather liking it than otherwise. As he strayed about--having\\nnothing to do that day in consideration of its being his last day at\\nhome--Colinâ\\x80\\x99s presence was by no means welcomed by the other people\\nabout the farm. Of course, being unoccupied himself, he had the\\nsharpest eyes for every blunder that was going on in the stable or the\\nbyre, and announced his little discoveries with a charming candour. But\\nin his heart, even at the moment when he was driving Jess to frenzy by\\nuncalled-for remarks touching the dinner of the pigs, Colin was all\\na-blaze with anticipation of the new life that was to begin to-morrow.\\nHe thought of it as something grand and complete, not made up of petty\\ndetails like this life he was leaving. It was a mist of learning, daily\\nstimulation and encounter of wits, with glorious prizes and honours\\nhanging in the hazy distance, which Colin saw as he went strolling about\\nthe farm-yard in the rain, with his hands in his pockets. If he said\\nanything articulate to himself on the subject, it was comprised in one\\nsuccinct, but seemingly inapplicable, statement. â\\x80\\x9cEtonâ\\x80\\x99s no a college,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said once, under his breath, with a dark glow of satisfaction on his\\nface as he stopped opposite the door, and cast a glance upon the loch\\nand the boat, which latter was now drawn up high and dry out of reach of\\nthe wintry water; and then a cloud suddenly lowered over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face,\\nas a sudden doubt of his own accuracy seized him--a torturing thought\\nwhich drove him indoors instantly to resolve his doubt by reference to a\\nwonderful old Gazetteer which was believed in at Ramore. Colin found it\\nrecorded there, to his great mental disturbance, that Eton _was_ a\\ncollege; but, on further inquiry, derived great comfort from knowing\\nthat it certainly was not a university, after which he felt himself\\nagain at liberty to issue forth and superintend and aggravate all the\\nbusy people about the farm.\\n\\nThat night the family supper-table was somewhat dull, notwithstanding\\nthe excitement of the boys, for Archie was to accompany his father and\\nbrother to Glasgow, and was in great glee over that unusual delight.\\nMrs. Campbell, for her part, was full of thoughts natural enough to the\\nmother of so many sons. She kept looking at her boys as they sat round\\nthe table, absorbed in their supper. â\\x80\\x9cThis is the beginning, but wha can\\ntell what may be the end?â\\x80\\x9d she said half to herself; â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99ll aâ\\x80\\x99 be gane\\nafore we ken what weâ\\x80\\x99re doing.â\\x80\\x9d Little Johnnie, to be sure, was but six\\nyears old; but the motherâ\\x80\\x99s imagination leapt over ten years, and saw\\nthe house empty, and all the young lives out in the world. â\\x80\\x9cEh me!â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe reflective woman, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s what we bring up our bairns for, and\\nrejoice over them as if they were treasure; and then by the time weâ\\x80\\x99re\\nauld theyâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 gane;â\\x80\\x9d and, as she spoke, not the present shadow only,\\nbut legions of vague desolations in the time to come came rolling up\\nlike mists upon her tender soul.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs lang as thereâ\\x80\\x99s you and me, weâ\\x80\\x99ll fend, Jeanie,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer,\\nwith a smile; â\\x80\\x9ctwaâ\\x80\\x99s very good company to my way oâ\\x80\\x99 thinking; but\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of time to think about the dispersion which canna take\\nplace yet for a year or twa. The boys came into the world to live their\\nain lives and serve their Maker, and noâ\\x80\\x99 just to pleasure you and me. If\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ve aâ\\x80\\x99 done, ye can cry on Jess, and bring out the big Bible, Colin.\\nWe maunna miss our prayers to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo tell the truth, Colin of Ramore was not quite so regular in his\\ndischarge of this duty as his next neighbour, Eben Campbell of Barnton,\\nthought necessary, and was disapproved of accordingly by that virtuous\\ncritic; but the homely little service was perhaps all the more touching\\non this special occasion, and marked the â\\x80\\x9cnight before Colin went first\\nto the college,â\\x80\\x9d as a night to be remembered. When his brothers trooped\\noff to bed, Colin remained behind as a special distinction. His mother\\nwas sitting by the fire without even her knitting, with her hands\\ncrossed in her lap, and clouds of troubled, tender thought veiling her\\nsoft eyes. As for the farmer, he sat looking on with a faint gleam of\\nhumour in his face. He knew that his wife was going to speak out her\\nanxious heart to her boy, and big Colinâ\\x80\\x99s respect for her judgment was\\njust touched by a manâ\\x80\\x99s smile at her womanish solemnity, and the great\\nunlikelihood that her innocent advices would have the effect she\\nimagined upon her sonâ\\x80\\x99s career. But, notwithstanding the smile, big\\nColin, too, listened with interest to all that his wife had to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome here and sit down,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell; â\\x80\\x9cyou neednaâ\\x80\\x99 think shame\\nof my hand on your head, though you _are_ gaun to the college the morn.\\nEh! Colin, you dinna ken aâ\\x80\\x99 the temptations nor the trials. Yeâ\\x80\\x99ve aye\\nhad your ain way at hame--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHere Colin made a little movement of irrepressible dissent. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve aye\\ndone what I was bidden,â\\x80\\x9d said the honest boy. He could not accept that\\ngentle fiction even when his heart was touched by his motherâ\\x80\\x99s farewell.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, weel,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, with a little sigh; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve had\\nyour ain way as far as it was good for you. But its awfuâ\\x80\\x99 different,\\nliving among strangers, and living in your fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. Yeâ\\x80\\x99ll have to\\nthink for yourselâ\\x80\\x99 and take care of yourselâ\\x80\\x99 now. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no one to give\\nmany advices,â\\x80\\x9d said the mother, putting up her hand furtively to her\\neyes, and looking into the fire till the tears should be re-absorbed\\nwhich had gathered there. â\\x80\\x9cBut I wouldna like my firstborn to leave\\nRamore and think aâ\\x80\\x99 was as fair in the world as appears to the common\\neâ\\x80\\x99e. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been real weel off aâ\\x80\\x99 my days,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, slowly,\\nletting the tears which she had restrained before drop freely at this\\nreminiscence of happiness; â\\x80\\x9ca guid father and mother to bring me up, and\\nthen _him_ there, thatâ\\x80\\x99s the kindest man!--But you and me needna praise\\nyour father, Colin; we can leave that to them that dinna ken,â\\x80\\x9d she went\\non, recovering herself; â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had ae trouble for aâ\\x80\\x99 so weel as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nbeen, and I mean to tell you what that is afore you set out in the world\\nfor yourselâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNothing about poor George,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, breaking in--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, Colin, just about poor George; I maun speak,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nmistress. â\\x80\\x9cHe was far the bonniest oâ\\x80\\x99 our family, and the best-likit;\\nand he was to be a minister, laddie, like you. He used to come hame with\\nhis prizes, and bring the very sunshine to the auld house. Eh! but my\\nmother was proud; and for me, I thought there was nothing in this world\\nhe mightnaâ\\x80\\x99 do if he likit. Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, with solemn\\nlooks, â\\x80\\x9care ye listening? The last time I saw my brother was in a puir\\nplace at Liverpool, aâ\\x80\\x99 in rags and dirt, with an auld coat buttoned to\\nhis throat, that it mightnaâ\\x80\\x99 be seen what was wantinâ\\x80\\x99, and aâ\\x80\\x99 his wild\\nhair hanginâ\\x80\\x99 about his face, and his feet out oâ\\x80\\x99 his shoon, and hunger\\nin his eye--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJeanie, Jeanie, nae mair,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin from the other side of the\\nfire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I maun say mair; I maun tell aâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d cried his wife, with tears.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHunger in his bonnie face, that was ance the blythest in the\\ncountry-side--no hunger for honest meat as nature might crave, but for\\naâ\\x80\\x99 thing that was unlawfuâ\\x80\\x99, and evil, and killinâ\\x80\\x99 to soul and body. He\\nhad to be watched for fear he should spend the hard-won silver that we\\nhad aâ\\x80\\x99 scraped together to send him away. Him that had been our pride,\\nwe couldna trust him, Colin, no ten minutes out oâ\\x80\\x99 our sight but he was\\nin some new trouble. It was to Australia we sent him, where aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nunfortunates go. Eh, me! the like oâ\\x80\\x99 that ship sailing! If there was a\\nkind oâ\\x80\\x99 hope in our breasts it was the hope oâ\\x80\\x99 despair. It wasnaâ\\x80\\x99 my\\nwill, for what is there in a new place to make a man reform his ways?\\nAnd that was how your Uncle George went away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then?â\\x80\\x9d cried the boy, whose interest was raised, and who had heard\\nmysteriously of this Uncle George before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99ve heard no word from that day to this,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, drying\\nher eyes. â\\x80\\x9cListen till I tell you aâ\\x80\\x99 that his pleasurings brought him\\nto. First, and greatest, to say what was not true, Colin--to deceive\\nthem that trusted him. If the day should ever dawn that I couldna trust\\na bairn oâ\\x80\\x99 mine--if it should ever come sickening to my heart that eâ\\x80\\x99e\\nor tongue was false that belonged to me--if I had to watch my laddies,\\nand to stand in doubt at every word they said--eh! Colin, God send I may\\nbe in my grave afore such an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fate should come to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nYoung Colin of Ramore answered not a word; he stared into the fire\\ninstead, making horrible faces unawares. He could not have denied, had\\nhe been taxed with it, that tears were in his eyes; but rather than shed\\nthem he would have endured tortures; and any expression of his feelings\\nin words was more impossible still.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo as if I was a better woman than my mother, or worthy oâ\\x80\\x99 a better\\nfate,â\\x80\\x9d said the thoughtful mistress of Ramore; â\\x80\\x9cfor she was ane oâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nexcellent of the earth, as aâ\\x80\\x99body kens; and if ever a woman won to her\\nrest through great tribulations, she was ane; and, if the Lord sent the\\ncross, He would send the strength to bear it. But oh! Colin, my man, it\\nwould be kind to drown your mother in the loch, or fell her on the hill,\\nsooner than bring upon her such great anguish and trouble as I have told\\nyou of this night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow, wife,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, interfering, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve said your part. Nae\\nsuch thought is in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s head. Gang you and look after his kist, and\\nsee that aâ\\x80\\x99 thingâ\\x80\\x99s right; and him and me will have our crack the time\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re away. Your motherâ\\x80\\x99s an innocent woman,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, after a\\npause, when she had gone away; â\\x80\\x9cshe kens nae mair of the world than the\\nbairn on her knee. When youâ\\x80\\x99re a man youâ\\x80\\x99ll ken the benefit of taking\\nyour first notions from a woman like that. No an imagination in her mind\\nbut whatâ\\x80\\x99s good and true. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard work fechting through this world\\nwithout marks oâ\\x80\\x99 the battle,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin with a little pathos; â\\x80\\x9cbut\\na man wiâ\\x80\\x99 the like oâ\\x80\\x99 _her_ by his side maun be ill indeed if he gangs\\nvery far wrang. It mightnaâ\\x80\\x99 be aâ\\x80\\x99 to the purpose,â\\x80\\x9d continued the farmer,\\nwith a little of his half-conscious common-sense superiority, â\\x80\\x9cas\\nappeals to the feelings seldom are; but, Colin, if you take my advice,\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll mind every word of what your mother says.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin said not a syllable in reply. He had got rid of the tears safely,\\nwhich was a great deal gained: they must have fallen had the mistress\\nremained two seconds longer looking at him with her soft beaming eyes;\\nbut he had not quite gulped down yet that climbing sorrow which had him\\nby the throat. Anyhow, even if his voice had been at his own command, he\\nwas very unlikely to have made any reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYeâ\\x80\\x99ll find aâ\\x80\\x99 strange when ye gang to Glasgow,â\\x80\\x9d continued the farmer.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no feared for any great temptation, except idleness, besetting a\\ncallant like you; but a man that has his ain bread and his ain way to\\nmake in the world, has nae time for idleness. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve guid abilities,\\nColin, and if they dinna come to something youâ\\x80\\x99ll have but yourselâ\\x80\\x99 to\\nblame: and I wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 put the reproach on my Maker of having brought a\\nuseless soul into the world, if I were you,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnever ony failures that I can see among the lower creation, without some\\nguid reason; but itâ\\x80\\x99s the privilege oâ\\x80\\x99 men to fail without ony cause oâ\\x80\\x99\\nfailure except want oâ\\x80\\x99 will to do weel. When ye see the like of George,\\nfor instance, ye ask what the Lord took the trouble to make such a\\nneâ\\x80\\x99er-do-weel for?â\\x80\\x9d said the homely philosopher; â\\x80\\x9cI never could help\\nthinking, for my part, that it was labour lost--though nae doubt\\nProvidence kent better; but I wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 be like _that_ if I could help\\nit. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no a silly sheep on the hill, nor horse in the stable, that\\nisnaâ\\x80\\x99 a credit to Him that made it. I would take good heed no to put\\nmyselâ\\x80\\x99 beneath the brute beasts, if I were you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no meaning,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, with ungrammatical abruptness and a\\nlittle offence; for he was pricked in his pride by this address, which\\nwas not, according to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s ideas, any â\\x80\\x9cappeal to his feelings,â\\x80\\x9d\\nbut a calm and common-sense way of putting an argument before the boy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never said you were,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll cost us hard work to\\nkeep ye at your studies, and I put it to your honour no to waste your\\ntime; and youâ\\x80\\x99ll write regular, and mind what kind oâ\\x80\\x99 thoughts your\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x99s thinking at home in Ramore; and I may tell you, Colin, I put\\nconfidence in you,â\\x80\\x9d said the father, laying his big hand with a heavy\\nmomentary pressure upon the ladâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cNow, good night, and go to\\nyour bed, and prepare for the morn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuch were the parting advices with which the boy was sent out into the\\nworld. His mother was in his room, kneeling before his chest, adding the\\nlast particulars to its store, when Colin entered the homely little\\nchamber--but what they said to each other before they parted was for\\nnobodyâ\\x80\\x99s ear; and the morning was blazing with a wintry brightness, and\\nall the hills standing white against the sky, and the heart of the\\nmistress hopeful as the day, when she wiped off her tears with her\\napron, and waved her farewell to her boy, as he went off in the little\\nsteamer which twice a day thrilled the loch with communications from the\\nworld. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll come back in the spring,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, as she went\\nabout her homely work, and ordered her household. And so young Colin\\nwent forth, all dauntless and courageous, into the great battlefield, to\\nencounter whatsoever conflicts might come to him, and to conquer the big\\nworld and all that was therein, in the victorious dreams of his youth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\n\\nThe first disappointment encountered by the young hero was the wonderful\\nshock of finding out that it was not an abstract world he had to\\nencounter and fight with, but that life was an affair of days and hours\\nexactly as at Ramore, which was about his first real mental experience\\nand discovery. It was a strange mortification to Colin, who was, like\\nhis mother, a poet in his soul, to find out that there was nothing\\nabstract in his new existence, but that a perpetually recurring round of\\nlessons to learn, and classes to attend, and meals to eat, made up the\\ndays, which were noways changed in their character from those days which\\nhe had already known for all the fifteen years of his life. After the\\nfirst shock, however, he went on with undiminished courage--for at\\nfifteen it is so easy to think that those great hours are waiting for us\\nsomewhere in the undisclosed orb of existence. Certainly a time would\\ncome when every day, of itself a radiant whole and complete unity, would\\nroll forth majestic like the earth in the mystic atmosphere. He had\\nmissed it this time, but after a while it must come; for the future,\\nlike the past, works wonders upon the aspect of time; and still it is\\ntrue of the commonest hours that they--\\n\\n                  ----â\\x80\\x9cwin\\n    A glory from their being far,\\n    And orb into the perfect star\\n    We saw not when we walked therein.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSo thought Colin, looking at them from the other side, and seeing a\\nperfection which nobody ever reached in this world. But of course he did\\nnot know that--so he postponed those grand days, and barred them up with\\nshining doors, on which was written the name and probable date of the\\nnext great change in his existence; and, contenting himself for the\\npresent with the ordinary hours, went light-hearted enough upon his\\nboyish way.\\n\\nA little adventure which occurred to the neophyte on his first entrance\\nupon this new scene, produced results for him, however, which are too\\nimportant to be omitted from his history. Everybody who has been in that\\ndingiest of cities knows that the students at the University of Glasgow,\\nsmall as their influence is otherwise upon the character of the town,\\nare bound to do it one superficial service at least. Custom has ordained\\nthat they should wear red gowns; and the fatigued traveller, weary of\\nthe universal leaden grey, can alone appreciate fully the sense of\\ngratitude and relief occasioned by the sudden gleam of scarlet\\nfluttering up the long unlovely street on a November day. But that\\nartistic sense which penetrates but slowly into barbarous regions has\\ncertainly not yet reached the students of Glasgow. So far from\\nconsidering themselves public benefactors through the medium of their\\nred gowns, there is no expedient of boyish ingenuity to which the\\nignorant youths will not resort to quench the splendid tint, and reduce\\nits glory as nearly as possible to the sombre hue of everything around.\\nBig Colin, of Ramore was unacquainted with the tradition which made a\\nnew and brilliant specimen of the academic robe of Glasgow as irritating\\nto the students as the colour is supposed to be to other animals of\\nexcitable temper; and the good farmer naturally arrayed his son in a new\\ngown, glorious as any new ensign in the first delight of his uniform. As\\nfor Colin, he was far from being delighted. The terrible thought of\\nwalking through the streets in that blazing costume seriously\\ncounterbalanced all the pleasure of independence, and the pride of being\\nâ\\x80\\x9cat college.â\\x80\\x9d The poor boy slunk along by the least frequented way, and\\nstole into his place the first morning like a criminal. And it was not\\nlong before Colin perceived that his new companions were of a similar\\nopinion. There was not another gown so brilliant as his own among them\\nall. The greater part were in the last stage of tatters and dinginess;\\nthough among a company, which included a number of lads of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s own\\nage, it was evident that there must be many who wore the unvenerated\\ncostume for the first time. Dreams of rushing to the loch, which had\\nbeen his immediate resource all his life hitherto, and soaking the\\nobnoxious wrapper in the saltwater, confused his mind; but he was not\\nprepared for the summary measures which were in contemplation. As soon\\nas Colin emerged out of the shelter of the class-room, his persecution\\ncommenced. He was mobbed, hustled, pelted, until his spirit was roused.\\nThe gown was odious enough; but Colin was not the lad to have even the\\nthing he most wanted imposed upon him by force. As soon as he was aware\\nof the meaning of his tormentors, the country boy stood up for his\\ncostume. He gathered the glowing folds round him, and struck out\\nfiercely, bringing down two or three of his adversaries. Colin, however,\\nwas alone against a multitude; and what might have happened either to\\nhimself or his dress it would have been difficult to predict, had not an\\nunexpected defender come in to the rescue. Next to Colin in the\\nclassroom a man of about twice his age had been seated--a man of thirty,\\nwhose gaunt shoulders brushed the boyâ\\x80\\x99s fair locks, and whose mature and\\nthoughtful head rose strangely over the young heads around. It was he\\nwho strode through the ring and dispersed Colinâ\\x80\\x99s adversaries.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor shame oâ\\x80\\x99 yourselves,â\\x80\\x9d he said in a deep bass voice, which\\ncontrasted wonderfully with the young falsettos round him. â\\x80\\x9cLeave the\\nladdie alone; he knows no better. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll lick ye aâ\\x80\\x99 for a set of\\nschoolboys, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t let him be. Here, boy, take off the red rag and\\nthrow it to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s new champion; but the Campbell blood was\\nup.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no take it off,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s my ain, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll wear it if I\\nlike; and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll fell anybody that meddles with me!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which, as was natural, a wonderful scuffle ensued. Colin never knew\\nperfectly how he was extricated from this alarming situation; but, when\\nhe came to himself, he was in the streets on his way home, with his new\\nfriend by his side--very stiff, and aching in every limb, with one\\nsleeve of his gown torn out, and its glory minished by the mud which had\\nbeen thrown at it, but still held tightly as he had gathered it round\\nhim at the first affray. When he recovered so far as to hear some other\\nsound besides his own panting breath, Colin discovered that the gaunt\\ngiant by his side was preaching at him in a leisurely reflective way\\nfrom his eminence of six feet two or three. Big Colin of Ramore was but\\nsix feet, and at that altitude two or three inches tell. The stranger\\nlooked gigantic in his lean length as the boy looked up, half wondering,\\nhalf-defiant, to hear what he was saying. What he said sounded\\nwonderfully like preaching, so high up and so composed was the voice\\nwhich kept on arguing over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s head, with an indifference to whether\\nhe listened or not, which, in ordinary conversation, is somewhat rare to\\nsee.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt might be right to stand up for your gown; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no commit myself to\\nsay,â\\x80\\x9d was the first sentence of the discourse which fell on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ear;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor thereâ\\x80\\x99s no denying it was your own, and a man, or even a callant,\\naccording to the case in point, has a right to wear what he likes, if\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s no under lawful authority, nor the garment offensive to decency;\\nbut it would have been more prudent on the present occasion to have\\ntaken off the red rag as I advised. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a remnant of superstition in\\nitself, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no altogether sure that my conscience, if it was put to\\nthe question, would approve of wearing gowns at all, unless, indeed, it\\nhad ceased to be customary to wear other garments; but thatâ\\x80\\x99s an\\nunlikely case, and I would not ask you to take it into consideration,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the calm voice, half a mile over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s head. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a kind of\\nrelic of the monastic system, which is out of accordance with modern\\nideas; but, as youâ\\x80\\x99re no old enough to have any opinions--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have as good a right to have opinions as you,â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Colin,\\npromptly, glad of an opportunity to contradict and defy somebody, and\\nget rid of the fumes of his excitement.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s no the subject under discussion,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger. â\\x80\\x9cI never\\nsaid any man had a right to opinions; I incline to the other side of\\nthat question myselâ\\x80\\x99. The thing we were arguing was the gown. A new red\\ngown is as aggravating to the students of Glasgow University as if they\\nwere so many bulls--no that I mean to imply that theyâ\\x80\\x99re anything so\\nforcible. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to yield to the popular superstition if you would\\nlive in peace.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no heeding about living in peace,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nfeared. Itâ\\x80\\x99s naebodyâ\\x80\\x99s business but my ain. My gown is my gown, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nno change it if--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet me speak,â\\x80\\x9d said his new friend; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re terrible talkative for a\\ncallant. Where do you live? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go home with ye and argue the question.\\nBesides, youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a knock on the head there that wants looking to, and\\nI suppose youâ\\x80\\x99re in Glasgow by yourself? You neednaâ\\x80\\x99 thank me, itâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nnecessary,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger, with a bland movement of the hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wasnaâ\\x80\\x99 meaning to thank you. Iâ\\x80\\x99m living in Donaldsonâ\\x80\\x99s Land, and I\\ncan take care of myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. But the boy was no match for his\\nexperienced classfellow, who went on calmly preaching as before, arguing\\nall kinds of questions, till the two arrived at the foot of the stairs\\nwhich led to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s humble lodging. The stair was long, narrow, and not\\nvery clean. It bore stains of spilt milk on one flight, and long\\ndroppings of water on another; and all the miscellaneous smells of half\\na dozen different households, none of them particularly dainty in their\\nhabits, were caught and concentrated in the deep well of a staircase,\\ninto which they all opened. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s abode was at the very top. His\\nlandlady was a poor widow, who had but three rooms, and a host of\\nchildren. The smallest of the three rooms was let to Colin, and in the\\nother two she put up somehow her own sons and daughters, and did her\\nmantua-making, and accomplished her humble cookery. The rooms had\\nsloping roofs and attic windows; and two chairs and a slip of carpet\\nmade Colinâ\\x80\\x99s apartment splendid. Colin led the way for his â\\x80\\x9cfriend,â\\x80\\x9d not\\nwithout a slight sentiment of pride, which had taken the place of his\\nfirst annoyance. After all, it was imposing to his imagination to have\\nhis society sought by another student, a man so much older than himself;\\nand Colin was not unaware of the worship which it would gain him in the\\neyes of his hostess, who had looked on him dubiously on the day of his\\narrival, and designated him â\\x80\\x9clittle mair than a bairn.â\\x80\\x9d Colin was very\\ngracious in doing the honours of his room to his unsolicited visitor,\\nand spoke loud out that Mrs. Fergus might hear. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll have to stoop\\nwhen you go in at _that_ door,â\\x80\\x9d said the boy, already learning with\\nnatural art to shine in reflected glory. But Colin was less complacent\\nwhen they had entered the room, half from natural shyness, half from an\\nequally natural defiance and opposition to the grown-up and experienced\\nperson who had escorted him home.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said this strange personage, stooping grimly to contemplate\\nhimself in the little square of looking-glass which hung over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntable; â\\x80\\x9cyou and me are no very like classfellows; but I like a laddie\\nthat has some spirit and stands up for his rights. Of course you come\\nfrom the country; but first come here, my boy, before you answer any\\nquestions, and let me see that knock on your head.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had nae intention of answering any questions; and I can take care of\\nmyself,â\\x80\\x9d answered Colin, hanging back and declining the invitation. The\\nstranger, however, only smiled, stretched out his long arm, and drew the\\nboy towards him. And certainly he had received a cut on the head which\\nrequired to be attended to. Reluctant as he was, the lad was too shy to\\nmake any active resistance, even if he had possessed moral courage\\nenough to oppose successfully the will of a man so much older than\\nhimself. He submitted to have the cut bathed and plastered up, which his\\nnew friend did with the utmost tenderness, delivering a slow and\\nlengthy address all the while over his head. When the operation was\\nover, Colin was more and more perplexed what to do with his visitor;\\nthough a little faint after his fight and excitement, he was still well\\nenough to be very hungry, but the idea of asking this unknown friend to\\nshare his dinner did not occur to him. He had never done anything beyond\\nlaunching the boat, or mounting the horses on his own responsibility\\nbefore, and he could not tell what Mrs. Fergus would think of his wound\\nor his visitor. Altogether, Colin was highly perplexed and not over\\ncivil, and sat down upon the edge of a chair facing the intruder with an\\nexpression of countenance very plainly intimating that he thought him\\nmuch in the way.\\n\\nBut the stranger was much above any consideration of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncountenance. He was very tall, as we have said, very gaunt and meagre,\\nwith a long, pale face surmounted by black locks, thin and dishevelled.\\nHe had a black beard, too--a thing much less common at that time than\\nnow--which increased his general aspect of dishevelment. His eyes were\\nlarge, and looked larger in the great sockets hollowed out by something\\nmore than years, from which they looked out as from two pale caverns;\\nyet, with all this gauntness of aspect, his smile, when he smiled, which\\nwas seldom, threw a wonderful light over his face, and reminded Colin\\nsomehow, he could not tell how, of the sudden gleam of the sun over the\\nHoly Loch when the clouds were at the darkest, and melted the boyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nheart in spite of himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was saying we were not very like classfellows,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s a queer feature in our Scotch colleges; thereâ\\x80\\x99s you, a great\\ndeal too young, and me, a great deal too old; and here we meet for the\\nsame purpose, to learn two dead languages and some sciences that are\\nonly half living; and thatâ\\x80\\x99s the only way for either you or me to get\\nourselves made ministers. The English systemâ\\x80\\x99s an awful deal better, Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nmeaning in theory;--as for the practice, thatâ\\x80\\x99s neither here nor there.\\nNothingâ\\x80\\x99s right in practice. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a great thing to have a right idea at\\nthe bottom if you can.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre you to be a minister?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, not well knowing what to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I was like you I thought so,â\\x80\\x9d said his new friend; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a long\\ntime since then; but, when I get a good grip of an idea, itâ\\x80\\x99s noâ\\x80\\x99 easy\\nto get it out of my head again. This is my second session only, for all\\nthat,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a momentary pause; â\\x80\\x9cmany a thing I little thought\\nof has stood in my way. Iâ\\x80\\x99m little further on than you, though I suppose\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m twice your age; but to be sure youâ\\x80\\x99re far too young for the\\ncollege; thatâ\\x80\\x99s what the Greek professor in Edinburgh is aye havering\\nabout; he might turn to the other side of the question if he knew me.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd the stranger interrupted his own monologue to give vent to a\\nlong-drawn breath, by way of a sigh, which agitated the atmosphere in\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s little room, as if it had been a sudden breeze.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Hardieâ\\x80\\x99s son was only thirteen when he went to the college; and\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s two years younger than me,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with some indignation.\\nThe lad heard a sound, as of knives and plates outside, and pricked up\\nhis ears. He was hungry, and his strange visitor seemed rooted upon his\\nhard rush-bottomed chair. But, just as Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind was framing this\\nthought, his companion suddenly gathered himself up, rising in folds, as\\nif there was never to be an end of him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou want your dinner?â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9ccome with me, it will do you good.\\nWhat you were to have will keep till to-morrow; tell the decent woman\\nso, and come with me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m poor, but you shall have something you can\\neat, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll show you what to do when you are tired of _her_\\nprovisions; so come along.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would rather stay at home,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know you, I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nknow even your name,â\\x80\\x9d he added a minute after, feeling that he was about\\nto yield to the strong influence which was upon him, and doing what he\\ncould to save himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy nameâ\\x80\\x99s Lauderdale; thatâ\\x80\\x99s easy settled,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger; â\\x80\\x9ctell\\nthe honest woman; whatâ\\x80\\x99s her name?--Iâ\\x80\\x99ll do it for you. Mrs. Fergus, my\\nyoung friend here is going to dinner with me. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll be back, by-and-by,\\nto his studies; and, in the meantime,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s self-constituted\\nguardian, putting the lad before him, and pausing in the passage to\\nspeak to the widow, who regarded his great height and strange appearance\\nwith a little curiosity, â\\x80\\x9ctake you charge of his gown; put it up the\\nchimney, or give it a good wash out with soap and soda; itâ\\x80\\x99s too grand\\nfor Glasgow College; the sooner it comes to be like this,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ngigantic visitor, holding up his own, which was of a dingy portwine\\ncolour, â\\x80\\x9cthe better for the boy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then Colin found himself again walking along the Glasgow streets, in\\nthe murky, early twilight of that November afternoon, with this strange\\nunknown figure which was leading him he knew not whither. Was it a good\\nor a bad angel which had thus taken possession of the fresh life and\\nunoccupied mind? Colin could not resist the fascination which was half\\ndislike and half admiration. He went along quietly by the side of the\\ntall student, who kept delivering over his head that flood of\\nmonotonous talk. The boy grew interested even in the talk before they\\nhad gone far, and went on, a little anxious about his dinner, but still\\nmore curious concerning the companion with whom Fate had provided him so\\nsoon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo that I mean to say I believe in fate,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, when they\\nhad finished their meal; â\\x80\\x9cthough there is little doubt in my mind that\\nwhat happens is ordained. I couldna tell why, for my part, though I\\nbelieve in the fact--for most things in life come to nothing, and the\\ngrandest train of causes produce nae effect whatsoever; thatâ\\x80\\x99s my\\nexperience. Indeed, itâ\\x80\\x99s often a wonder to me,â\\x80\\x9d said the homely\\nphilosopher, who was not addressing himself particularly to Colin, â\\x80\\x9cwhat\\nthe Almighty took the trouble to make man for at aâ\\x80\\x99. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a poor\\ncreature at the best, and gives an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal of trouble for very little\\ngood. Considering all things, Iâ\\x80\\x99m of opinion that weâ\\x80\\x99re little better\\nthan an experiment,--and very likely weâ\\x80\\x99ve been greatly improved upon in\\nmair recent creations. Are you pleased with your dinner? Youâ\\x80\\x99re young\\nnow, and cannaâ\\x80\\x99 have much standing against you in the great books. Do\\nyou ever think, laddie, of what you mean to be?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI mean to be a minister,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a furious blush. His\\nthoughts on the subject, if he could but have expressed them, were\\nmagnificent enough, but nothing was more impossible to the shy country\\nlad, than to explain the ambition which glowed in his eager, visionary\\nmind. He would have sacrificed a finger at any time, rather than talk of\\nthe vague but splendid intentions which were fermenting secretly in\\nabsolute silence within his reserved Scotch bosom. His new friend looked\\nwith a little curiosity at the subdued brightness of the boyâ\\x80\\x99s eyes,\\nwhich spoke more emphatically than his words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey aâ\\x80\\x99 mean to be ministers,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, in his reflective way;\\nâ\\x80\\x9chalf of them would do far better to be cobblers; but nae fool could\\never be persuaded. As for you, I think thereâ\\x80\\x99s something in you, or I\\nwouldna have fashed my head about you and your gown. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve got a fair\\nstart, and nae drawbacks. I would like to see you go straight forward,\\nand be good for something in your generation. You needna look glum at\\nme; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never be good for much myselâ\\x80\\x99. You see Iâ\\x80\\x99ve learnt to be fond\\nof talking,â\\x80\\x9d he said, philosophically; â\\x80\\x9cand a man that takes up that\\nline early in life seldom comes to much good; though I grant you thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nexceptions, like Macaulay, for example. I was just entered at college,\\nwhen my father died,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, falling into a historical strain, â\\x80\\x9cI\\nwas only a laddie like yourselâ\\x80\\x99, but I had to give up that thought, and\\nwork to help the rest. Now they are all scattered, and my mother dead,\\nand Iâ\\x80\\x99m my own master. No that Iâ\\x80\\x99m much the better for that; but, you\\nsee, after I got this situationâ\\x80\\x9d----\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat situation?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, quickly.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, an honourable occupation,â\\x80\\x9d said his tall friend, with a gradually\\nbrightening smile. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s ane of the same trade mentioned with\\ncommendation in the Acts of the Apostles. Him and St. Paul were great\\nfriends. But you see Iâ\\x80\\x99m free for the most part of the day; and, it\\nbeing a fixed idea in my mind that I was to go to the college some time\\nor other, it was but natural that I should enter myselâ\\x80\\x99 as soon as I was\\nable. I may go forward, and I may not; it depends on the world more than\\non me. So your nameâ\\x80\\x99s Colin Campbell?--the same as Sir Colin; but, if\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re to be a minister, you can never be anything mair than a minister.\\nIn any other line of life a lad can rise if he likes, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae\\npromotion possible to _that_. If I were you, and fifteen, I would choose\\nanother trade.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo this Colin answered nothing; the suggestion staggered him\\nconsiderably, and he was not prepared with anything to say. He looked\\nround the shabby room, and watched the shabby tavern-waiter carrying his\\ndinner to some other customer; and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s new and unaccustomed eyes saw\\nsomething imposing even in the aspect of this poor place. He thought of\\nthe great world which seemed to surge outside in a ceaseless roar,\\ncoming and going--the world in which all sorts of honours and powers\\nseemed to go begging, seeking owners worthy to possess them: and he was\\npursuing this splendid chain of possibilities, when Lauderdale resumed\\nhis monologue:--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Kirkâ\\x80\\x99s in a queer kind of condition aâ\\x80\\x99thegither,â\\x80\\x9d said the tall\\nstudent; â\\x80\\x9cso are most Kirks. Whenever you hit upon a man that kens what\\nhe wants, allâ\\x80\\x99s well; but that happens seldom. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no my case for one.\\nAnd as for you, youâ\\x80\\x99re no at the age to trouble your head about\\ndoctrine. Youâ\\x80\\x99re a young prince at your years--you donâ\\x80\\x99t know your\\nprivileges; you believe everything youâ\\x80\\x99ve been brought up to believe,\\nand are far more sure in your own mind whatâ\\x80\\x99s false and whatâ\\x80\\x99s true\\nthan a college of doctors. I would rather be you than aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nphilosophers in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no a fool to believe everything,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, angrily, rousing\\nhimself up from his dreams.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said his companion, â\\x80\\x9cfar from a fool; itâ\\x80\\x99s true wisdom if you\\ncould but keep it. But the present temper of the world,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher calmly, â\\x80\\x9cis to conclude that thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing aâ\\x80\\x99thegither\\nfalse, and few things particularly true. When youâ\\x80\\x99re tired of the\\ndinners in Donaldsonâ\\x80\\x99s Land,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, without any change of tone,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand from the looks of the honest woman I would not say much for the\\ncookery, you can come and get your dinner here. In the meantime, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\ntake ye up to Buchanan Street, if you like. Itâ\\x80\\x99s five oâ\\x80\\x99clock, and the\\nshop-windows are lighted by this time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m very fond of the lights in\\nthe shop-windows myselâ\\x80\\x99. When Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been a poor laddie about the streets,\\nthe lights aye looked friendly, which is more than the folk within do\\nwhen youâ\\x80\\x99ve no siller. Come along; itâ\\x80\\x99s no trouble to me, and I like to\\nhave somebody to talk to,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale.\\n\\nColin got up very reluctantly, feeling himself unable to resist the\\nstrange personal fascination thus exercised over him. The idea of being\\nonly somebody to talk to mortified the boyâ\\x80\\x99s pride, but he could not\\nshake himself free from the influence which had taken possession of him.\\nHe was only fifteen, and his companion was thirty; and he had no power\\nto enfranchise himself. He went after the tall figure into the street\\nwith very mingled feelings. The stream of talk, which kept flowing on\\nabove him, stimulated Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind into the most vigorous action. Such\\ntalk was not incomprehensible to a boy who had been trained at Ramore;\\nbut the philosophers of the Holy Loch were orthodox, and this specimen\\nof impartial thoughtfulness roused all the fire of youthful polemics in\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s bosom. He set down his companion unhesitatingly, of course, as a\\nâ\\x80\\x9csceptic,â\\x80\\x9d perhaps an infidel; and was already longing to rush in upon\\nhim, with arbitrary boyish zeal and disdain, to make an end on the spot\\nof his mistaken opinions. As for Colin himself, he was very sure of\\neverything, as was natural to his years, and had never entertained any\\ndoubts that the Shorter Catechism was as infallible a standard of truth,\\nas it was a terrible infliction upon the youthful memory. Colin went\\nalong the murky streets, by his companionâ\\x80\\x99s side, thinking within\\nhimself that, perhaps, his own better arguments and higher reason might\\nconvert this mistaken man, and listened to him eagerly as they\\nproceeded together along the long line of the Trongate, much excited by\\nhis own intentions, and feeling somehow, in his boyish heart, that this\\nuniversal stimulation of everything, within and without, was a real\\nbeginning of life. For everything was new to the country boy, who had\\nnever in his life before been out of doors at night, anywhere, save in\\nthe silent country roads, through darkness lighted by the moon, or, when\\nthere was no moon, by the pale glimmer of the loch. Now his eyes were\\ndazzled by the lights, and all his senses kept in exercise by the\\nnecessity of holding his own way, and resisting the pressure of the\\nhuman current which flowed past him; while Lauderdale kept talking of a\\nhundred things which were opposed to his boyish belief, and which, amid\\nall this unaccustomed hubbub, he had to listen to with all his might\\nlest he should lose the thread of the argument--a loose thread enough,\\ncertainly, but still with some coherence and connexion. All this made\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s heart thrill with a warmer consciousness of life. He was only in\\nGlasgow, among floods of dusky craftsmen going home from their work; but\\nit appeared to his young eyes that he had suddenly fallen upon the most\\nfrequented ways of life and into the heart of the vast world.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m fond of a walk in the Trongate myselâ\\x80\\x99, especially when the lamps\\nare lighted,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cI never heard of a philosopher but was.\\nNo that I am much of a philosopher, but--. Itâ\\x80\\x99s here ye see the real\\naspect of human affairs. Here, take the shopwindows, or take the\\npassengers, thereâ\\x80\\x99s little to be seen but whatâ\\x80\\x99s necessary to life; but\\nyonder,â\\x80\\x9d said the reflective student, pointing over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s head to the\\nstreet they were approaching, â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing but luxury. We spend a\\ngreat deal of siller in Glasgow--weâ\\x80\\x99re terrible rich, some of us, and\\nlike the best of everything--but thereâ\\x80\\x99s no so much difference as you\\nwould think. I have no pleasure in that side of wealth for my part;\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s an awful suggestion of eating and drinking in everything about\\nthere. Even the grand furniture and the pictures have a kind of haze\\nabout them, as if ye could only see them through a dinner. I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\npretend to have any knowledge for my own part of rich menâ\\x80\\x99s feasts; but\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s no think pleasant to that Genius and Art, no to speak of a great\\ndeal of skilful workmanship, should be all subservient to a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\npleasure in his dinner, and that _thatâ\\x80\\x99s_ what theyâ\\x80\\x99re here for. Hallo,\\nladdie, I thought you had no friends in Glasgow? thereâ\\x80\\x99s somebody yonder\\nwaving their hands to you. What do you hang back for? itâ\\x80\\x99s a lady in a\\ncarriage. Have you no respect for yourselâ\\x80\\x99 that youâ\\x80\\x99re so slow to\\nanswer?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colinâ\\x80\\x99s monitor, indignantly. Colin would gladly have\\nsunk through the pavement, or darted up a friendly dark alley which\\npresented itself close by, but such an escape was not possible. It was\\nLady Frankland who was making signals to him out of the carriage-window,\\nand with all his awkwardness, he was obliged to obey them.\\n\\nAs for Lauderdale, whose curiosity was considerably excited, he betook\\nhimself to the window of a printshop to await his _protÃ©gÃ©_, not without\\nsome surprise in his mind. He knew pretty nearly as much about Colin by\\nthis time as the boy himself did, though Colin was quite unaware of\\nhaving opened up his personal history to his new friend; but he had\\nheard nothing about young Frankland, that being an episode in his life\\nof which the country lad was not proud. Lauderdale stood at the\\nprintshop-window with a curious kind of half-pathetic egotism mingling\\nwith his kindly observation. No fair vision of women ever gleamed across\\n_his_ firmament. He was just about shaking hands with youth, and no\\nladyâ\\x80\\x99s face had ever bent over him like a star out of the firmament, as\\nthe gracious countenance of the English lady was just then bending over\\nthe farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son from Ramore. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s maybe the Duchess,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale\\nto himself, thinking of the natural feudal princess of the lochs; and he\\nlooked with greater interest still, withdrawn out of hearing, but near\\nenough to see all that passed. Colin for his part did not know in the\\nleast what to say or to do. He stood before the carriage looking sulky\\nin the excess of his embarrassment, and did not even take off his cap to\\nsalute the lady, as country politeness and his anxious mother had taught\\nhim. And, to aggravate the matter, there was a bewildering little girl\\nin the carriage with Lady Frankland--a creature with glorious curls over\\nher shoulders, and a wonderful perfection of juvenile toilette, which\\nsomehow dazzled Colinâ\\x80\\x99s unused and ignorant eyes. In the midst of his\\nawkwardness it occurred to the boy to note this little ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dress,\\nwhich was a strange thing enough for him, who did not know one article\\nof feminine attire from another. It was not her beauty so much as the\\ndelicacy of all her little equipments which amazed Colin, and prevented\\nhim from hearing what Lady Frankland had to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you have gone to the University?â\\x80\\x9d said that gracious lady. â\\x80\\x9cYou are\\never so much further advanced than Harry, who is only a schoolboy as\\nyet; but the Scotch are so clever. You will be glad to hear that dear\\nHarry is quite well, and enjoying himself very much at Eton,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s mother, who meant to be very kind to the boy who had saved her\\nsonâ\\x80\\x99s life. Now the very name of Harry Frankland had, he could not have\\ntold how, a certain exasperating effect upon Colin. He said nothing in\\nanswer to this satisfactory intelligence, but unconsciously gave a\\nlittle frown of natural opposition, which Lady Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were not\\nsufficiently interested to see.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care for Harry, aunt,â\\x80\\x9d said the miniature woman by Lady\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s side, darting out of the dusky twilight a sudden flash of\\nperception, under which Colin stood convicted. She was about his own\\nage, but a world in advance of him in every other respect. A little\\namusement and a little offence were in the voice, which seemed to Colin,\\nwith its high-bred accent and wonderful â\\x80\\x9cEnglish,â\\x80\\x9d like the voice of\\nanother kind of creature from any he had encountered before. Was she a\\nlittle witch, to know what he was thinking? And then a little laugh of\\ntriumph rounded off the sentence, and the unfortunate boy stood more\\nspeechless, more awkward, more incapable than before.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNonsense, Matty; when you know we owe Harryâ\\x80\\x99s life to him,â\\x80\\x9d said bland\\nLady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cYou must come and dine with us to-morrow; indeed you\\nmust. Sir Thomas and I are both so anxious to know more of you. Sir\\nThomas would be so pleased to forward your views in any way; but the\\nScotch are so independent,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with her most flattering smile.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWas that your tutor who was walking with you, that very tall man? I am\\nsure we should be delighted to see him too. I suppose he is something in\\nthe University. Oh! here comes my husband. Sir Thomas, this is--Oh! I am\\nsure I beg your pardon; I forget your name--the dear, brave, excellent\\nboy who saved Harryâ\\x80\\x99s life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Sir Thomas, coming out of one of the shops, in that radiance\\nof cleanness and neatness, perfectly brushed whiskers, and fresh face,\\nwhich distinguishes his class, shook hands heartily with the reluctant\\nColin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, he must dine with us to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d said the good-humoured\\nbaronet, â\\x80\\x9cand bring his tutor if he likes; but I thought you had no\\ntutors at the Scotch Universities. I want to know what youâ\\x80\\x99re about, and\\nwhat your ideas are on a great many subjects, my fine fellow. Your\\nfather is tremendously proud, and so are you, I suppose; but heâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ncapital specimen of a man; and I hope you allow that I have a right to\\nrecollect such an obligation. Good-bye, my boy,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSeven to-morrow--but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll probably be at your college and see you in\\nthe morning. And mind you bring the tutor,â\\x80\\x9d he cried, as the carriage\\ndrove off. Lady Frankland shed a perfect blaze of smiles upon Colin, as\\nshe waved her hand to him, and the creature with the curls on the other\\nside gave the boy a little nod in a friendly condescending way. He made\\na spring back into the shade the minute after, wonderfully glad to\\nescape, but dazzled and excited in spite of himself; and, as he retired\\nrapidly from the scene of this unexpected encounter, he came sharp up\\nagainst Lauderdale, who was coming to meet him, with his curiosity\\nlargely excited.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was me he took for the tutor, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d said the strange Mentor\\nwho had thus taken possession of Colin; and the tall student laughed\\nwith a kind of quaint gratification. â\\x80\\x9cAnd so I might have been if I had\\nbeen bred up at Oxford or Cambridge,â\\x80\\x9d he added, after a moment; â\\x80\\x9cthat is\\nto say, if it had been my lot to be bred up anywhere; but theyâ\\x80\\x99ve a\\ngrand system in these English universities. _That_ was not the Duke,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid interrogatively, looking at Colin, whose blood of clansman boiled\\nat the idea.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_That_ the Duke!â\\x80\\x9d exclaimed the boy with great disdain; â\\x80\\x9cno more than I\\nam. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one of the English that are aye coming and making their jokes\\nabout the rain; as if anybody wanted them to come,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with an\\noutbreak of scorn; and then the boy remembered that Archie Candlish had\\njust bought a house in expectation of such visitors, and stopped\\nabruptly in full career. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose the English are awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fond of\\ngrouse, or they wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 come so far for two or three birds,â\\x80\\x9d he\\ncontinued, in a tone of milder sarcasm. But his companion was not to be\\nso easily diverted from his questions.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGrouse is a grand institution, and helps in the good government of this\\ncountry,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cand, through this country, of the\\nworld--which is a fine thought for a bit winged creature, if it had the\\nsense to ken. Yonâ\\x80\\x99s another world,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a little pause, â\\x80\\x9cno\\nParadise to be sure, but something as far removed from this as Heaven\\nitself; farther, you might say, for thereâ\\x80\\x99s many a poor man down below\\nhere thatâ\\x80\\x99s hovering on the edge of heaven. And how came you to have\\nsuch grand friends?â\\x80\\x9d asked the self-constituted guardian, stooping from\\nhis lofty height to look straight into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. After a time, he\\nextracted the baldest narrative that ever was uttered by a hero ashamed\\nof his prowess from the half-indignant boy, and managed to guess as\\nclearly as the wonderful little lady in the carriage the nature of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments towards the young antagonist and rival whom he had\\nsaved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wouldna have let a dog drown,â\\x80\\x9d said the aggrieved Colin; â\\x80\\x9cthere was\\nnothing to make a work about. But you would have laughed to see that\\nfellow, with his boots like a lassieâ\\x80\\x99s and feared to wet his feet. He\\ncould swim, though,â\\x80\\x9d added the boy, candidly; â\\x80\\x9cand I would like to beat\\nhim,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a moment; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d like to run races with him for\\nsomething, and win the prize over his head.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was all Colin permitted himself to say; but the vehement sentiment\\nthus recalled to his mind made him, for the moment, less attentive to\\nLauderdale, who, for his part, was considerably moved by his young\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x99s excitement. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not going to see your fine friends,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid, as he parted from the boy at the â\\x80\\x9cstairfootâ\\x80\\x9d which led to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlodging; â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s many a true word spoken in jest, and, my boy, you\\nshall not want a tutor, though thereâ\\x80\\x99s no such thing in our Scotch\\ncolleges.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen he had said so much, hastily, as a man does who is conscious of\\nhaving shown a little emotion in his words, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s new friend went\\naway, disappearing through the misty night, gaunt and lean as another\\nQuixote. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to have something to do with the making of a new\\nlife,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, muttering high up in the air over the\\nordinary passengersâ\\x80\\x99 heads, as he mused on upon his way. And Colin and\\nhis story had struck the rock in the heart of the lonely man, and drawn\\nforth fresh streams in that wilderness. He was more moved in his\\nimaginative, reflective soul, than he could have told any one, with,\\nhalf-consciously to himself, a sense of contrast, which was natural\\nenough, considering all things, and which coloured all his thoughts,\\nmore or less, for that night.\\n\\nAs for Colin--naturally, too--he thought no more of Lauderdale, nor of\\nhis parting words, and found himself in no need of any tutor or guide,\\nbut fell asleep in the midst of his Greek, as was to be expected, and\\ndreamt of that creature with the curls nodding at him out of gorgeous\\nLord Mayorâ\\x80\\x99s coaches, in endless procession. And it was with this\\nwonderful little vision dancing about his fancy that the Scotch boy\\nended his first day at the University, knowing no more what was to come\\nof it all than the saucy sparrow which woke him next morning by loud\\nchirping in the Glasgow dialect at his quaint little attic window. The\\nsparrow had his crumbs, and Colin had another exciting day before him,\\nand went out quite calmly to lay his innocent hands upon the edge-tools\\nwhich were to carve out his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\n\\nWonders come natural at fifteen; the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son of Ramore, though a\\nlittle dazzled at the moment, was by no means thrown off his balance by\\nthe flattering attentions of Lady Frankland, who said everything that\\nwas agreeable and forgot that she had said it, and went over the same\\nground again half a dozen times, somewhat to the contempt of Colin, who\\nknew nothing about fine ladies, but had all a boyâ\\x80\\x99s disdain for a silly\\nwoman. Thanks to his faculty of silence, and his intense pride, Colin\\nconducted himself with great external propriety when he dined with his\\nnew friends. Nobody knew the fright he was in, nor the strain of\\ndetermination not to commit himself, which was worthy of something more\\nimportant than a dinner. But after all, though it shed a reflected glory\\nover his path for a short time, Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s dinner and all\\nits bewildering accessories was but an affair of a day, and the only\\nreal result it left behind was a conviction in the mind of Lauderdale\\nthat his young _protÃ©gÃ©_ was born to better fortune. From that day the\\ntall student hovered, benignly reflective, like a tall genie over\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s boyish career. He was the boyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor so far as that was\\npossible where the teacher was himself but one step in advance of the\\npupil; and as to matters speculative and philosophical, Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmonologue, delivered high up in the air over his head, became the\\naccompaniment and perpetual stimulation of all Colinâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts. The\\ntraining was strange, but by no means unnatural, nor out of harmony with\\nthe habits of the boyâ\\x80\\x99s previous life, for much homely philosophy was\\ncurrent at Ramore, and Colin had been used to receive all kinds of\\ncomments upon human affairs with his daily bread. Naturally enough,\\nhowever, the sentiments of thirty and those of fifteen were not always\\nharmonious, and the impartial and tolerant thoughtfulness of his tall\\nfriend much exasperated Colin in the absolutism of his youth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a man of the age,â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale would say as they traversed the\\ncrowded streets together; â\\x80\\x9cby which I am claiming no superiority over\\nyou, callant, but far the contrary, if you were but wise enough to ken.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve fallen into the groove like the rest of mankind, and think in\\nlimits as belongs to my century--which is but a poor half-and-half kind\\nof century, to say the best of it--but you are of all the ages, and know\\nnothing about limits or possibilities. Donâ\\x80\\x99t interrupt me,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nplacid giant; â\\x80\\x9cyou are far too talkative for a laddie, as I have said\\nbefore. I tell you Iâ\\x80\\x99m a man of the age: Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no very particular faith\\nin anything. In a kind of a way, everythingâ\\x80\\x99s true; but you needna tell\\nme that a man that believes like _that_ will never make much mark in\\nthis world or any other world I ever heard tell of. I know that, a great\\ndeal better than you do. The best thing you can do is to contradict me;\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s good for you, and it does me no harm.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin acted upon this permission to the full extent of all his youthful\\nprowess and prejudices, and went on learning his Latin and Greek, and\\ndiscussing all manner of questions in heaven and earth, with the fervour\\nof a boy and a Scotsman. They kept together, this strange pair, for the\\ngreater part of the short winter days, taking long walks, when they left\\nthe University, through the noisy dirty streets, upon which Lauderdale\\nmoralized; and sometimes through the duller squares and crescents of\\nrespectability which formed the frame of the picture. Sometimes their\\nperegrinations concluded in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s little room, where they renewed\\ntheir arguments over the oatcakes and cheese which came in periodical\\nhampers from Ramore; and sometimes Lauderdale gave his friend a cheap\\nand homely dinner at the tavern where they had first broken bread\\ntogether. But not even Colin, much less any of his less familiar\\nacquaintances, knew where the tall Mentor lived, or how he managed to\\nmaintain himself at college. He said he had his lodging provided for\\nhim, when any inquiry was made, and added, with an odd humourous look,\\nthat his was an honourable occupation; but Lauderdale afforded no\\nfurther clue to his own means or dwelling-place. He smiled, but he was\\nsecret and gave no sign. As for his studies, he made but such moderate\\nprogress in them as was natural to his age and his character. No\\nparticular spur of ambition seemed to stimulate the man whose habits\\nwere formed by this time, and who found enjoyment enough, it appeared,\\nin universal speculation. When he failed, his reflections as to the\\neffect of failure upon the mind of man, and the secondary importance\\nafter all of mere material success, â\\x80\\x9cwhich always turns out more\\ndisappointing to a reflective spirit than an actual break-down,â\\x80\\x9d the\\nphilosopher would say, â\\x80\\x9cbeing aye another evidence how far reality falls\\nshort of the idea,â\\x80\\x9d became more piquant than usual; and when he\\nsucceeded, the same sentiments moderated his satisfaction. â\\x80\\x9cOh ay, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ngot the prize,â\\x80\\x9d he said, holding it on a level with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s head, and\\nregarding its resplendent binding with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cwhich is to say, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nfound out that itâ\\x80\\x99s only a book with the college arms stamped upon it,\\nand no a palpable satisfaction to the soul as I might have imagined it\\nto be, had it been yours, boy, instead of mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut with all this composure of feeling as respected his own success,\\nLauderdale was as eager as a boy about the progress of his pupil. When\\nthe prize lay in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s way, his friend spared no pains to stimulate\\nand encourage and help him on; and as the years passed, and the personal\\npride of the elder became involved in the success of the younger,\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s anxieties awoke a certain impatience in the bosom of his\\n_protÃ©gÃ©_. Colin was ambitious enough in his own person, but he turned\\nnaturally with sensitive boyish pride against the arguments and\\ninducements which had so little influence upon the speaker himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou urge _me_ on,â\\x80\\x9d he would say, â\\x80\\x9cbut you think it does not matter for\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d And though it was Colinâ\\x80\\x99s third session, and he reckoned\\nhimself a man when he said this, he was jealous to think that Lauderdale\\nurged upon him what he did not think it worth his while to practise in\\nhis own person.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen a thingâ\\x80\\x99s spoilt in the making, it matters less what use ye put it\\nto,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher. It was a bright day in March, and they were\\nseated on the grass together in a corner of the Green, looking at the\\npretty groups about, of women and children--children and women, perhaps\\nnot over tidy, if you looked closely into the matter, but picturesque to\\nlook at--some watching the patches of white linen bleaching on the\\ngrass, and some busily engaged over their needlework. The tall student\\nstretched his long limbs on the grass, and watched the people about with\\nreflective eyes. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing in this world so important to a man as\\na right beginning,â\\x80\\x9d he went on. â\\x80\\x9cAs for me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m all astray, and can\\nnever win to any certain end--no that Iâ\\x80\\x99m complaining, or taking a\\ngloomy view of things in general; Iâ\\x80\\x99m just as happy in my way as other\\nfolk are in theirs--but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no the question under discussion. When a\\nman reaches my years without coming to anything heâ\\x80\\x99ll never come to much\\nall his days; but youâ\\x80\\x99re only a callant, and have all the world before\\nyou, said Lauderdale.â\\x80\\x9d He did not look at Colin as he spoke, but went on\\nin his usual monotone, looking into the blue air, in which he saw much\\nthat was not visible to the eager young eyes which kept gazing at him.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen I was like you,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, with a half-pathetic,\\nhalf-humourous smile, â\\x80\\x9cit looked like misery and despair to feel that I\\nwas not to get my own way in this world. Iâ\\x80\\x99m terrible indifferent\\nnow-a-days--one kind of life is just as good as another as long as a man\\nhas something to do that he can think to be his duty; but such thoughts\\nare no for you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s tutor, waking up suddenly. â\\x80\\x9cFor you,\\nladdie, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing grand in the world that should not be possible.\\nThe lot thatâ\\x80\\x99s accomplished is aye more or less a failure; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nalways something splendid in the life that is to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou talk to me as if I were a child,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a little\\nindignation; â\\x80\\x9cyou see things in their true light yourself, but you treat\\nme like a baby. What can there be that is splendid in my life?--a\\nfarmerâ\\x80\\x99s son, with perhaps the chance of a country church for my highest\\nhope--after all kinds of signings, and confessions, and calls, and\\npresbyteries. It would be splendid, indeed,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, with boyish\\ncontempt, â\\x80\\x9cto be plucked by a country presbytery that donâ\\x80\\x99t know six\\nwords of Greek, or objected to by a congregation of ploughmen--thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nall a man has to look for in the Church of Scotland, and you know it,\\nLauderdale, as well as I do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin broke off suddenly, with a considerable show of heat and\\nimpatience. He was eighteen, and he was of the advanced party, the Young\\nScotland of his time. The dogmatic Old Scotland, which loved to bind,\\nand limit, and make confessions, and sign the same, belonged to the past\\ncenturies. As for Colinâ\\x80\\x99s set, they were â\\x80\\x9cviewyâ\\x80\\x9d as the young men at\\nOxford used to be in the days of Froude and Newman. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s own â\\x80\\x9cviewsâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwere of a vague description enough, but of the most revolutionary\\ntendency. He did not believe in Presbytery, nor in that rule of Church\\ngovernment which in Scotland is known as Lord Aberdeenâ\\x80\\x99s Act; and his\\nideas respecting extempore worship and common prayer were much\\nunsettled. But as neither Colin nor his set had any distinct model to\\nfall back upon, nor any clear perception of what they wanted, the\\npresent result of their enlightenment was simply the unpleasant one of\\ngeneral discontent with existing things, and a restless contempt for the\\nnecessary accessories of their lot.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPlucked is no a word in use in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cit smacks\\nof the English universities, which are altogether a different matter. As\\nfor the Westminster Confession, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no clear that I could put my name to\\nthat myself as my act and deed--but you are but a callant, and donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nknow your own mind as yet. Meaning no offence to you,â\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\nwaving his hand to Colin, who showed signs of impatience, â\\x80\\x9cI was once a\\nladdie myself. Between eighteen and eight-and-twenty youâ\\x80\\x99ll change your\\nways of thinking, and neither you nor me can prophesy what theyâ\\x80\\x99ll end\\nin. As for the congregation of ploughmen, I would be very easy about you\\nif that was the worst danger. Men that are about day and night in the\\nfields when allâ\\x80\\x99s still, cannot but have thoughts in their minds now and\\nthen. But itâ\\x80\\x99s no what you are going to be, Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s counsellor, raising himself from the grass with a spark of\\nunusual light in his eyes, â\\x80\\x9cbut what you _might_ be, laddie. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no a\\ngreat preacher, far less what they call a popular minister, that would\\nplease me. What Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of is, the Man that is aye to be looked\\nfor, but never comes. Iâ\\x80\\x99m speaking like a woman, and thinking like a\\nwoman,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cthey have a kind of privilege to keep\\ntheir ideal. For my part, I ought to have more sense, if experience\\ncounted for anything; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no faith in experience. And, speaking of\\nthat,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, dropping back again softly on the\\ngreensward, â\\x80\\x9cwhat a grand outlet for what Iâ\\x80\\x99m calling the ideal was that\\nold promise of the Messias who was to come! It may still be so for\\nanything I can tell, though I cannot say that I put much trust in the\\nJews. But aye to be able to hope that the next new soul might be the One\\nthat was above failure, must have been a wonderful solace to them that\\nhad failed and lost heart. To be sure, they missed Him when He came,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cthat was natural. Human nature is aye defective\\nin action; but a grand idea like that makes all the difference between\\nus and the beasts, and would do, if there were a hundred theories of\\ndevelopment--which I would not have you put faith in, laddie,â\\x80\\x9d continued\\nthe volunteer tutor. â\\x80\\x9cSteam and iron make awful progress, but no man--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is one of your favourite theories,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was ready for\\nany amount of argument; â\\x80\\x9cthough iron and steam are dead and stationary,\\nbut for the mind which is always developing. What you say is a kind of\\nparadox; but you like paradoxes, Lauderdale.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEverythingâ\\x80\\x99s a paradox,â\\x80\\x9d said the reflective giant, getting up slowly\\nfrom the turf; â\\x80\\x9cand the grass is damp, and the windâ\\x80\\x99s cold, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmean to sit here and haver nonsense any longer. Come along, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll see\\nyou home. What I like women for is, that theyâ\\x80\\x99re seldom subject to the\\nreal, or convinced by what you callants call reason. Reason and reality\\nare terrible fictions at the bottom. I never believe in facts, for my\\npart. The worst of it is, that a womanâ\\x80\\x99s ideal is apt to look a terrible\\nidiot when she sets it up before the world,â\\x80\\x9d continued Lauderdale, his\\nface brightening gradually with one of his slow smiles. â\\x80\\x9cThe ladiesâ\\x80\\x99\\nnovels are instructive on that point. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s few things in this\\nworld so pleasant as to have a woman at hand that believes in you,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid, suddenly breaking off in his discourse at an utterly unexpected\\nmoment. Colin was startled by the unlooked-for silence, and by the sound\\nof something like a sigh which disturbed the air over his head; and\\nbeing still but a boy, and not superior to mischief, looked up, with a\\nlittle laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must have once had a woman who believed in you, or you would not\\nspeak so feelingly,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, in his youthful amusement; and then\\nColin, too, stopped short, having encountered quite an unaccustomed look\\nin his companionâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, and then there was a pause. â\\x80\\x9cIf it were not that\\nlife is aye a failure, there would be some cases harder than could be\\nborne,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, after a moment; â\\x80\\x9cno that Iâ\\x80\\x99m complaining; but if I\\nwere you, laddie, I would set my face dead against fortune, and make up\\nmy mind to win. And speaking of winning, when did you hear of your grand\\nEnglish friends, and the callant you picked out of the loch? Have they\\never been here in Glasgow again?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which question Colin drew himself to his full height, as he always\\ndid at Harry Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s name; he was ashamed now to express his natural\\nantagonism to the English lad in frank speech as he had been used to do,\\nbut he insensibly elevated his head, which, when he did not stoop, as he\\nhad a habit of doing, began to approach much more nearly than of old to\\nthe altitude of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know nothing about their movements,â\\x80\\x9d he said, shortly. â\\x80\\x9cAs for\\nwinning, I donâ\\x80\\x99t see what connexion there can be between the Franklands\\nand any victory of mine. You donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose Miss Matilda believes in me,\\ndo you?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with an uneasy laugh; â\\x80\\x9cfor that would be a\\nmistake,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, a moment after. â\\x80\\x9cShe believes in her cousin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, in his oracular way, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s an uncanny kind of\\nrelationship upon the whole; but I would not be the one to answer for\\nit, especially if itâ\\x80\\x99s him sheâ\\x80\\x99s expected to believe in. But there were\\nno Miss Matildas in my mind,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no ask what\\nshe had to do in yours, for youâ\\x80\\x99re but a callant, as I have to remind\\nyou twenty times in a day. But such lodgers are no to be encouraged,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colinâ\\x80\\x99s adviser, with seriousness; â\\x80\\x9cwhen they get into a young head\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s hard to get them out again; and the worst of them is, that they\\ntake more room than their fair share. Have you got your essay well in\\nhand for the Principal? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s more to the purpose than Miss Matilda;\\nand now the end of the sessionâ\\x80\\x99s drawing near, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m a thought anxious\\nabout the philosophy class. Yon Highland colt with the red hair will run\\nyou close, if you donâ\\x80\\x99t take heed. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no prizes Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking upon,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s the whole plan of the campaign. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll come up and\\ntalk it all over again, if you want advice; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve great confidence in\\nyour own genius.â\\x80\\x9d As he said this, he laid his hand upon the ladâ\\x80\\x99s\\nshoulder and looked down into his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cSummerâ\\x80\\x99s the time to dream,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the tall student, with a smile and a sigh. Perhaps he had given\\nundue importance to the name of Miss Matilda. He looked into the fresh\\nyoung face with that mixture of affection and pathos--ambition for the\\nlad, mingled with a generous, tender envy of him--which all along had\\nmoved the elder man in his intercourse with Colin. The look for once\\npenetrated through the mists of custom and touched the boyâ\\x80\\x99s heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are very good to me, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a little effusion;\\nat the sound of which words his friend grasped his shoulder\\naffectionately and went off, without saying anything more, into the\\ndingy Glasgow streets. Colin himself paused a minute to watch the tall,\\nretreating figure before he climbed his own tedious stair. â\\x80\\x9cSummerâ\\x80\\x99s the\\ntime to dream,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated to himself, with a certain brightness in his\\nface, and went up the darkling staircase three steps at a time,\\nstimulated most probably by some thoughts more exciting than anything\\nconnected with college prizes or essays. It was the end of March, and\\nalready now and then a chance breeze whispered to Colin that the\\nprimroses had begun to peep out about the roots of the trees in all the\\nsoft glens of the Holy Loch. It had only been in the previous spring\\nthat primroses became anything more to Colin than they were to Peter\\nBell; but now the youthâ\\x80\\x99s eyes were anointed--he had begun to write\\npoetry, and to taste the delights of life. Though he had already learned\\nto throw a very transparent vein of pretended sadness upon his verses,\\nit did not occur to Colin as possible that the life which was so sweet\\none year might not be equally delightful the next, or that anything\\ncould occur to deprive him of the companionship he was looking forward\\nto. He had never received any shock yet in his youthful certainty of\\npleasure, and did not stop to think that the chance which brought Sir\\nThomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s nursery, and with it his pretty niece, to the Castle,\\nfor all the long spring and summer, might never recur again. So he went\\nupstairs three steps at a time, in the dingy twilight, and sat down to\\nhis essay, raising now and then triumphant, youthful eyes, which\\nsurveyed the mean walls and poor little room without seeing anything of\\ntheir poverty, and making all his young, arrogant, absolute philosophy\\nsweet with thoughts of the primroses, and the awaking waters, and the\\nother human creature, the child-Eve of the boyâ\\x80\\x99s Paradise. This was how\\nColin managed to compose the essay, which drew tears of mingled laughter\\nand emotion from Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and dazzled the professor himself\\nwith its promise of eloquence, and secured the prize in the philosophy\\nclass. The Highland colt with the red hair, who was Colinâ\\x80\\x99s rival, was\\nvery much sounder in his views, and had twenty times more logic in his\\ncomposition; but the professor was dazzled, and the class itself could\\nscarcely forbear its applause. Colin went home accordingly covered with\\nglory. He was nearly nineteen; he was one of the most promising students\\nof the year; he had already distinguished himself sufficiently to\\nattract the attention of people interested in college successes; and he\\nhad all the long summer before him, and no one could tell how many\\nrambles about the glens, how many voyages across the loch, how many\\nresearches into the wonders of the hills. He bade farewell to Lauderdale\\nwith a momentary seriousness, but forgot before the smoke of Glasgow was\\nout of sight that he had ever parted from anybody, or that all his\\nfriends were not awaiting him in this summer of delight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome away into the fire; itâ\\x80\\x99s bonnie weather, but itâ\\x80\\x99s sharp on the\\nhillside,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress of Ramore. â\\x80\\x9cI never wearied for you, Colin,\\nso much as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done this year. No that there was ony particular\\noccasion, for weâ\\x80\\x99ve aâ\\x80\\x99 been real weel, and a good season, and baith\\nbairns and beasts keeping their health; but the heartâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ncapricious, and canna hear reason. Come in bye to the fire.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s been three days of east wind,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, who had gone\\nacross the loch to meet his son, and bring him home in triumph, â\\x80\\x9cwhich\\naccounts for your motherâ\\x80\\x99s anxiety, Colin. When thereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of blue\\nsky, and the sun shining, thereâ\\x80\\x99s naething she hasna courage for. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndoing in Glasgow? or rather whatâ\\x80\\x99s doing at the college? or maybe, if\\nyou insist upon it, what are you doing? for thatâ\\x80\\x99s the most important to\\nus.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo which Colin, who was almost as shy of talking of his own achievements\\nas of old, gave for answer some bald account of the winding up of the\\nsession, and of his own honours. â\\x80\\x9cI told you all about it in my last\\nletter,â\\x80\\x9d he said, hurrying over the narrative; â\\x80\\x9cthere was nothing out of\\nthe common. Tell me rather all the news of the parish. Who is at home\\nand who is away, and if any of the visitors have come yet?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nlad, with a conscious tremor in his voice. Most likely his mother\\nunderstood what he meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s ower early for visitors yet,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cthough I think for my\\npart thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing like the spring, with the days lengthening, and the\\nlight aye eking and eking itself out. To be sure, thereâ\\x80\\x99s the east\\nwinds, which are a sore drawback, but they have nae great effect on the\\nwest coast. The castle woods are wonderful bonnie, Colin; near as bonnie\\nas they were last year, when aâ\\x80\\x99 thae bright English bairnies made the\\nplace look cheerful. I wonder the Earl bides there so seldom himself.\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99s no rich, to be sure, but itâ\\x80\\x99s a moderate kind of a place. If I had\\nenough money I would rather live there than in the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s palace, and\\nso the minister says. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to go down to the manse the morn, and\\ntell him aâ\\x80\\x99 about your prizes, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said his proud mother, looking at\\nhim with beaming eyes. She put her hand upon her boyâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, and\\npatted him softly as he stood beside her. â\\x80\\x9cHe takes a great interest in\\nwhat youâ\\x80\\x99re doing at the college,â\\x80\\x9d she continued; â\\x80\\x9che says youâ\\x80\\x99re a\\ncredit to the parish, and so I hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll aye be,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell.\\nShe had not any doubt on the subject so far as her own convictions went.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe does not know me,â\\x80\\x9d said the impatient Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go to the\\nmanse to-morrow if you like. Itâ\\x80\\x99s halfway to the castle,â\\x80\\x9d he said, under\\nhis breath, and then felt himself colour, much to his annoyance, under\\nhis motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty folk to visit,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer. â\\x80\\x9cAs for the castle,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s out of our way, no to say it looked awfuâ\\x80\\x99 doleful the last time I\\nwas by. The factor would get it but for the name of the thing. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve had\\na wonderful year, take it aâ\\x80\\x99thegither, and the weather is promising for\\nthe season. If youâ\\x80\\x99re no over-grand with all your honours, I would be\\nglad of your advice, as soon as youâ\\x80\\x99ve rested, about the Easter fields.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of some changes, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae time to lose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you would but let the laddie take breath!â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNew out of all his toils and his troubles, and you canna refrain from\\nthe Easter fields. Itâ\\x80\\x99s my belief,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, with a little\\nsolemnity, â\\x80\\x9cthat prosperity is awfuâ\\x80\\x99 trying to the soul. I dinna think\\nyou ever cared for siller, Colin, till now; but instead of rejoicing in\\nyour heart over the Almightyâ\\x80\\x99s blessing, I hear nothing, from morning to\\nnight, but about mair profit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been used to,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, â\\x80\\x9cand thereâ\\x80\\x99s mony a thing mair important that I want to\\nhear about. Eh! Colin, itâ\\x80\\x99s my hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll no get to be over-fond of\\nthis world!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf this world meant no more than a fifty pound or so in the bank,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nbig Colin, with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s no denying itâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful\\ncomfort to have a bit margin, and no be aye from hand to mouth. As soon\\nas your motherâ\\x80\\x99s satisfied with looking at you, you can come out to me,\\nColin, and have a look at the beasts. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a pleasure to see them. Apart\\nfrom profit, Jeanie,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, with his humorous look, â\\x80\\x9cif you\\nobject to that, itâ\\x80\\x99s grand to see such an improvement in a breed of\\nliving creatures that you and me spend so much of our time among. Next\\nto bonnie bairns, bonnie cattleâ\\x80\\x99s a reasonable pride for a farmer, no to\\nsay but that making siller in any honest way is as laudable an\\noccupation as I ken for a man with a family like me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it doesna take up your heart,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 to\\nhear folk how they crave siller for sillerâ\\x80\\x99s sake; especially in a place\\nlike this, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s aye strangers coming and going, and aâ\\x80\\x99 bodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\naye trying how much is to be got for everything. I promised the laddies\\na holiday the morn to hear aâ\\x80\\x99 Colinâ\\x80\\x99s news, and youâ\\x80\\x99re no to take him\\noff to byres and ploughed land the very first day;--though I dinna say\\nbut I would like him to see Gowanâ\\x80\\x99s calf,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife,\\nyielding a little in her superior virtue. As for Colin, he sat very\\nimpatiently through this conversation, vainly attempting to bring in the\\nquestion which he longed, yet did not like, to ask.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose the visitors will come early, as the weather is so fine?â\\x80\\x9d he\\nventured to say as soon as there was a pause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, the Glasgow folk,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell; and she gave a curious\\ninquiring glance at her son, who was looking out of the window with\\nevery appearance of abstraction. â\\x80\\x9cDo you know anybody thatâ\\x80\\x99s coming,\\nColin?â\\x80\\x9d said the anxious mother; â\\x80\\x9csome of your new friends?â\\x80\\x9d And Colin\\nwas so sensible of her look, though his eyes were turned in exactly the\\nopposite direction, that his face grew crimson up to the great waves of\\nbrown hair which were always tumbling about his forehead. He thrust his\\nheavy lovelocks off his temples with an impatient hand, and got up and\\nwent to the window that his confusion might not be visible. Big Colin of\\nRamore was at the window too, darkening the apartment with his great\\nbulk, and the farmer laid his hand on his sonâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder with a homely\\nroughness, partly assumed to conceal his real feeling.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow tall are you, laddie? no much short of me now,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cLook\\nhere, Jeanie, at your son.â\\x80\\x9d Then the mistress put down her work, and\\ncame up to them, defeating all Colinâ\\x80\\x99s attempts to escape her look; but\\nin the meantime she, too, forgot the blushes of her boy in the pleasant\\nsight before her. She was but a little woman herself, considered in the\\ncountryside rather too soft and delicate for a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife; and with\\nall the delicious confidence of love and weakness, the tender woman\\nlooked up at her husband and her son.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYoung Mr. Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s no half so tall as Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the proud mother;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cno that height is anything to brag about unless aâ\\x80\\x99 things else is\\nconformable. Heâ\\x80\\x99s weel enough, and a strong-built callant, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ngreat difference; though, to be sure, his mother is just as proud,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe mistress, bearing her conscious superiority with meekness; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ngrand thing that weâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 best pleased with our ain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen did you see young Frankland?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, hastily. The two boys\\nhad scarcely met since the encounter which had made a link between the\\nfamilies without awaking very friendly sentiments in the bosoms of the\\ntwo persons principally concerned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s a thing to be discussed hereafter,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer of Ramore.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI didna mean to say onything about it till I saw what your inclinations\\nwere, but women-folk are aye hasty Sir Thomas has made me a proposition,\\nColin. He would like to send you to Oxford with his own son if you and\\nme were to consent. Weâ\\x80\\x99re to gie him an answer when weâ\\x80\\x99ve made up our\\nminds. Nae doubt he has heard that you were like enough to be a\\ncreditable protejee,â\\x80\\x9d said Big Colin, with natural complacency. â\\x80\\x9cA lad\\nof genius gies distinction to his patron--if ye can put up with a\\npatron, Colin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCan _you_?â\\x80\\x9d cried his son. The lad was greatly agitated by the\\nquestion. Ambitious Scotch youths of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s type, in the state of\\ndiscontent which was common to the race, had come to look upon the\\nEnglish universities as the goal of all possible hopes. Not that Colin\\nwould have confessed as much had his fate depended on it--but such was\\nthe fact notwithstanding. Oxford, to his mind, meant any or every\\npossibility under heaven, without any limit to the splendour of the\\nhopes involved. A different kind of flush, the glow of eagerness and\\nambition, suddenly covered his face. But joined with this came a tumult\\nof vague but burning offence and contradiction. While he recognised the\\nglorious chance thus opened to him, pride started up to bolt and bar\\nthose gates of hope. He turned upon his father with something like anger\\nin his voice, with a tantalizing sense of all the advantages thus\\nflourished wantonly, as he thought, before his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cCould _you_ put up\\nwith a patron?â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, looking almost fiercely in the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nface; â\\x80\\x9cand if not, why do you ask me such a question?â\\x80\\x9d When he came to\\nthink of it, Colin felt injured by the suggestion. To be offered the\\nthing of all others he most desired in the world, by means which made it\\nimpossible to accept the offer would have been galling enough under any\\ncircumstances; but just now, at this crisis of his youthful ambition and\\nexcitement, such a tantalizing glimpse of the possible and the\\nimpossible was beyond bearing. â\\x80\\x9cAre we his dependents that he makes such\\nan offer to me?â\\x80\\x9d said the exasperated youth; and Big Colin himself\\nlooked on with a little surprise at his sonâ\\x80\\x99s excitement, comprehending\\nonly partially what it meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no say Iâ\\x80\\x99m fond of patronage,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, slowly; â\\x80\\x9cneither\\nin the kirk nor out of the kirk. Itâ\\x80\\x99s my opinion a man does aye best\\nthat fights his own way; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s aye exceptions, Colin. I wouldna\\nhave you make up your mind in any arbitrary way. As for Sir Thomas, he\\nhas aye been real civil and friendly--no one of your condescending fine\\ngentlemen--and the son--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat right have I to any favour from Sir Thomas?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin. â\\x80\\x9cHe is\\nnothing to me. I did no more for young Frankland than I would have done\\nfor any dog on the hillside,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, with a contemptuous tone;\\nand then his conscience reproved him. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to say anything\\nagainst _him_. He behaved like a man, and saved himself,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nwith haughty candour. â\\x80\\x9cAs for all this pretence of rewarding me, it\\nfeels like an insult. I want nothing at their hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no occasion to be violent,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer. â\\x80\\x9cI dinna expect\\nthat heâ\\x80\\x99ll use force to make you accept his offer, which is weel meant\\nand kind, whatever else it may be. I canna say I understand aâ\\x80\\x99 this fury\\non your part; and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no good that I can see in deciding this very\\nmoment and no other. I would like you to sleep upon it and turn it over\\nin your mind. Such an offer doesna come every day to the Holy Loch. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno the man to seek help,â\\x80\\x9d said Big Colin, â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s times when itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmore generous to receive than to give.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe mistress had followed her son wistfully with her eyes through all\\nhis changes of countenance and gesture. She was not simply surprised\\nlike her husband, but looked at him with unconscious insight,\\ndiscovering by intuition what was in his heart--something, at least, of\\nwhat was in his heart--for the anxious mother too was mistaken, and\\nrushed at conclusions which Colin himself was far from having reached.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty of time to decide,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife; â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nthat confidence in my laddie that I ken heâ\\x80\\x99ll do nothing from a poor\\nmotive, nor out of a jealous heart. There never were ony sulky ways,\\nthat ever I saw, in ony bairn of mine,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell; â\\x80\\x9cand if\\nthere was one in the world that was mair fortunate than me, I wouldna\\nshow a poor spirit towards him, because he had won. Whiles itâ\\x80\\x99s mair\\ngenerous to receive than to give, as the maister says; and whiles itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmair noble to lose than to win,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, with a momentary\\nfaltering of emotion in her voice. She thought the bitterness of\\nhopeless love was in her boyâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and that he was tempted to turn\\nfiercely from the friendship of his successful rival. And she lifted her\\nsoft eyes, which were beaming with all the magnanimous impulses of\\nnature, to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face, who did not comprehend the tenderness of pity\\nwith which his mother regarded him. But, at least, he perceived that\\nsomething much higher and profounder than anything he was thinking of\\nwas in the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts; and he turned away somewhat abashed from\\nher anxious look.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not jealous that I am aware of,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut I have never\\ndone anything to deserve this, and I should prefer not to accept any\\nfavours from--any man,â\\x80\\x9d he concluded abruptly. That was how they left\\nthe discussion for that time at least. When the farmer went out to look\\nafter his necessary business, his wife remained with Colin, looking at\\nhim often, as she glanced up from her knitting, with eyes of wistful\\nwonder. Had she been right in her guess, or was it merely a vague\\nsentiment of repulsion which kept him apart from young Frankland? But\\nall the motherâ\\x80\\x99s anxiety could not break through the veil which\\nseparates one mysterious individuality from another. She read his looks\\nwith eager attention, half right and half wrong, as people make out an\\nunfamiliar language. He had drifted off somehow from the plain\\nvernacular of his boyish thoughts, and she had not the key to the new\\ncomplications. So it was with a mixed and doubtful joy that the mistress\\nof Ramore, on the first night of his return, regarded her son.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a smile dancing about his lips, â\\x80\\x9cthat\\nI am to answer this proposal when they come to the castle? And they are\\ncoming soon as they expected last year? or, perhaps, they are there\\nnow?â\\x80\\x9d he said, getting up from his chair again and walking away towards\\nthe door that his mother might not see the gleam of expectation in his\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, Colin, my man,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress, who did not perceive the blow\\nshe was about to administer, â\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re no coming to the castle this year.\\nThe young lady that was delicate has got well, and theyâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 in London\\nand in an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 whirl oâ\\x80\\x99 gaiety like the rest of their kind; and Lady\\nMary, the earlâ\\x80\\x99s sister, is to have the castle with her bairns; and\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s the way Sir Thomas wants our answer in a letter, for thereâ\\x80\\x99s none\\nof the family to be here this year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt did not strike the mistress as strange that Colin made no answer. He\\nwas standing at the door looking out, and she could not see his face.\\nAnd when he went out of doors presently, she was not surprised--it was\\nnatural he should want to see everything about the familiar place; and\\nshe called after him to say that, if he would wait a moment, she would\\ngo herself and show him Gowanâ\\x80\\x99s calf. But he either did not hear her,\\nor, at least, did not wait the necessary moment; and when she had\\nglanced out in her turn, and had perceived with delight that the wind\\nhad changed, and that the sun was going down in glorious crimson and\\ngold behind the hills, the mistress returned with a relieved heart to\\nprepare the family tea. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll be a fine day to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d she said to\\nherself, rejoicing over it for Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sake; and so went in to her\\ndomestic duties with a lightened heart.\\n\\nAt that moment Colin had just pushed forth into the loch, flinging\\nhimself into the boat anyhow, disgusted with the world and himself and\\neverything that surrounded him. In a moment, in the drawing of a breath,\\nan utter blank and darkness had replaced all the lovely summer landscape\\nthat was glowing by anticipation in his heart. In the sudden pang of\\ndisappointment, the ladâ\\x80\\x99s first impulse was to fling himself forth into\\nthe solitude, and escape the voices and looks which were hateful to him\\nat that moment. Nor was it simple disappointment that moved him; his\\nfeelings were complicated by many additional shades of aggravation. It\\nhad seemed so natural that everything should happen this year as last\\nyear, and now it seemed such blind folly to imagine that it could have\\nbeen possible. Not only were his dreams all frustrated and turned to\\nnothing, but he fell ever so many degrees in his own esteem, and felt so\\nfoolish and vain and blind, as he turned upon himself with the acute\\nmortification and sudden disgust of youth. What an idiot he had been! To\\nthink she would again leave all the brilliant world for the loch and the\\nprimroses, and those other childish delights on which he had been\\ndwelling like a fool! Very bitter were Colinâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts, as he dashed\\nout into the middle of the loch, and there laid up his oars and\\nabandoned himself to the buffetings of excited fancy. What right had he\\nto imagine that she had ever thought of him again, or to hope that such\\na thread of gold could be woven into his rustic and homely web of fate?\\nHe scoffed at himself, as he remembered, with acute pangs of\\nself-contempt, the joyous rose-coloured dreams that had occupied him\\nonly a few hours ago. What a fool he was to entertain such vain,\\ncomplacent fancies! He, a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son, whose highest hope must be,\\nafter countless aggravations and exasperations, to get â\\x80\\x9cplacedâ\\x80\\x9d in a\\ncountry church in some rural corner of Scotland. And then Colin recalled\\nSir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s proposal, and took to his oars again in a kind of\\nfury, feeling it impossible to keep still. The baronetâ\\x80\\x99s kind offer\\nlooked like an intentional insult to the excited lad. He thought to\\nhimself that they wanted to reward him somehow by rude, tangible means,\\nas if he were a servant, for what Colin proudly and indignantly declared\\nto himself was no service--certainly no intentional service. On the\\nwhole, he had never been so wretched, so downcast, so fierce and angry\\nand miserable, in all his life. If he could but, by any means, by any\\ntoil, or self-denial, or sacrifice, get to Oxford, on his own account,\\nand show the rich man and his son how little the Campbells of Ramore\\nstood in need of patronage! All the glory had faded off the hills before\\nColin bethought himself of the necessity of returning to the homely\\nhouse which he had greeted with so much natural pleasure a few hours\\nbefore. His mother was standing at the door looking out for him as he\\ndrew towards the beach, looking at him with eyes full of startled and\\nanxious half-comprehension. She knew he was disturbed somehow, and made\\nguesses, right in the main, but all wrong in the particulars, which\\nwere, though he tried hard to repress all signs of it, another\\nexasperation to Colin. This was how the first evening of his return\\nclosed upon the student of Ramore. He could not take any pleasure just\\nthen in the fact of being at home, nor in the homely love and respect\\nand admiration that surrounded him. Like all the rest of the world, he\\nneglected the true gold lying close at hand for the longing he had after\\nthe false diamonds that glittered at a distance. It was hard work for\\nhim to preserve an ordinary appearance of affection and interest in all\\nthat was going on, as he sat, absent and preoccupied, at his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntable. â\\x80\\x9cColinâ\\x80\\x99s no like you idle laddies; he has ower much to think of\\nto laugh and make a noise, like you,â\\x80\\x9d the mistress said with dignity, as\\nshe consoled the younger brothers, who were disappointed in Colin. And\\nshe half believed what she said, though she spoke with the base\\nintention of deluding â\\x80\\x9cthe laddies,â\\x80\\x9d who knew no better. The house, on\\nthe whole, was rather disturbed than brightened by the return of the\\nfirstborn, who had thus brought a foreign element into the household\\nlife. Such was the inauspicious beginning of the holidays, which had\\nbeen to Colin, for months back, the subject of so many dreams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\n\\nIt was some time before Colin recovered his composure, or found it\\npossible to console himself for the failure of his hopes. He wrote a\\ngreat deal of poetry in the meantime--or rather of verses which looked\\nwonderfully like poetry, such as young men of genius are apt to produce\\nunder such circumstances. The chances are, that if he had confided them\\nto any critic of a sympathetic mind, attempts would have been made to\\npersuade Colin that he was a poet. But luckily Lauderdale was not at\\nhand, and there was no one else to whom the shy young dreamer would have\\ndisclosed himself. He sent some of his musings to the magazines, and so\\nadded a little excitement and anxiety to his life. But nobody knew Colin\\nin that little world where, as in other worlds, most things go by\\nfavour, and impartial appreciation is comparatively unknown. The editors\\nmost probably would have treated their unknown correspondent in exactly\\nthe same manner had he been a young Tennyson. As it was, Colin did not\\nquite know what to think about his repeated failures in this respect.\\nWhen he was despondent he became disgusted with his own productions, and\\nsaid to himself that of course such maudlin verse could be procured by\\nthe bushel, and was not worthy of paper and print. But in other moods\\nthe lad imagined he must have some enemy who prejudiced the editorial\\nworld, and shut against him the gates of literary fame. In books all the\\nheroes, who could do nothing else, found so ready a subsistence by means\\nof magazines, that the poor boy was naturally puzzled to find that all\\nhis efforts could not gain him a hearing. And it began to be rather\\nimportant to him to find something to do. During the previous summers\\nColin had not disdained the farm and its labours, but had worked with\\nhis father and brothers without any sense of incongruity. But now\\nmatters were changed. Miss Matty, with her curls and her smiles, had\\nbewitched the boy out of his simple innocent life. It did not seem\\nnatural that the hand which she consented to touch with her delicate\\nfingers should hold the plough or the reaping hook, or that her\\ncompanion in so many celestial rambles should plod through the furrows\\nat other times, or go into the rough drolleries of the harvest field.\\n\\nColin began to think that the life of a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son at Ramore was\\ninconsistent with his future hopes, and there was nothing else for it\\nbut teaching, since so little was to be made of the magazines. When he\\nhad come to himself and began to see the surrounding circumstances with\\nclearer eyes, Colin, who had no mind to be dependent, but meant to make\\nhis own way as was natural to a Scotch lad of his class, bethought\\nhimself of the most natural expedient. He had distinguished himself at\\ncollege, and it was not difficult to find the occupation he wanted.\\nPerhaps he was glad to escape from the primitive home, from the motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\npenetrating looks, and all the homely ways of which the ambitious boy\\nbegan to be a little impatient. He had come to the age of discontent. He\\nhad begun to look forward no longer to the vague splendours of boyish\\nimagination, but to elevation in the social scale, and what he heard\\npeople call success in life. A year or two before it had not occurred to\\nColin to consider the circumstances of his own lot;--his ambition\\npointed only to ideal grandeur, unembarrassed by particulars--and it was\\nvery possible for the boy to be happy, thinking of some incoherent\\ngreatness to come, while engaged in the humblest work, and living in the\\nhomeliest fashion. But the time had arrived when the pure ideal had to\\ntake to itself some human garments, and when the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son became\\naware that a scholar and a gentleman required a greater degree of\\nexternal refinement in his surroundings. His young heart was wounded by\\nthis new sense, and his visionary pride offended by the thought that\\nthese external matters could count for anything in the dignity of a man.\\nBut Colin had to yield like every other. He loved his family no less,\\nbut he was less at home among them. The inevitable disruption was\\ncommencing, and already, with the quick insight of her susceptible\\nnature, the mistress of Ramore had discovered that the new current was\\nsetting in, that the individual stream of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s life was about to\\ndisengage itself, and that her proud hopes for her boy were to be sealed\\nby his separation from her. The tender-hearted woman said nothing of it,\\nexcept by an occasional pathetic reflection upon things in general,\\nwhich went to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and which he understood perfectly; but\\nperhaps, though no one would have confessed as much, it was a relief to\\nall when the scholar-son, of whom everybody at Ramore was so proud, went\\noff across the loch, rowed by two of his brothers, with his portmanteau\\nand the first evening coat he had ever possessed, to Ardmartin, the fine\\nhouse on the opposite bank, where he was to be tutor to Mr. Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nboys, and eat among strangers the bread of his own toil.\\n\\nThe mistress stood at the door shading her eyes with her hand, and\\nlooking after the boat as it shot across the bright water. Never at its\\nheight of beauty had the Holy Loch looked more fair. The sun was\\nexpanding and exulting over all the hills, searching into every hollow,\\nthrowing up unthought-of tints, heaps of moss, and masses of rock, that\\nno one knew of till that moment; and with the sunshine went flying\\nshadows that rose and fell like the lifting of an eyelid. The gleam of\\nthe sun before she put up her hand to shade her face fell upon the tear\\nin the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s eye, and hung a rainbow upon the long lash, which was\\nwet with that tender dew. She looked at her boys gliding over the loch\\nthrough this veil of fairy colours, all made out of a tear, and the\\nheart in her tender bosom beat with a corresponding conjunction of pain\\nand happiness. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll never more come back to bide at home like his\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s son,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, softly, with a pang of natural\\nmortification; â\\x80\\x9cbut, eh, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a thankless woman to complain, and him so\\nweel and so good, and naething in fant but nature,â\\x80\\x9d added the mother,\\nwith all the compunction of true love; and so stood gazing till the boat\\nhad gone out of hearing, and had begun to enter that sweet shadow of the\\nopposite bank, projected far into the loch, which plunged the whole\\nlandscape into a dazzling uncertainty, and made it a doubtful matter\\nwhich was land and which was water. Colin himself, touched by the\\nloveliness of the scene, had paused just then to look down the shining\\nline to where this beatified paradise of water opened out into the\\nheaven of Clyde. And to his motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes gazing after him, the boat\\nseemed to hang suspended among the sweet spring foliage of the Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nGlen, which lay reflected, every leaf and twig, in the sweeter loch.\\nWhen somebody called her indoors she went away with a sigh. Was it\\nearth, or a vision of Paradise, or â\\x80\\x9csome unsubstantial fairy place?â\\x80\\x9d The\\nsense of all this loveliness struck intense, with almost a feeling of\\npain, upon the gentle womanâ\\x80\\x99s poetic heart.\\n\\nAnd it was in such a scene that Colin wrote the verses which borrowed\\nfrom the sun and the rain prismatic colours like those of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntears, and were as near poetry as they could possibly be to miss that\\nglory. Luckily for him he had no favourite confidant at hand to persuade\\nhim that he was a poet; so the verse-making did him nothing but good,\\nproviding a safety-valve for that somewhat stormy period of his\\nexistence.\\n\\nMr. Jordan was very rich and very liberal, and, indeed, lavish of the\\nmoney which had elevated him above all his early friends and\\nassociations. He had travelled, he bought pictures, he prided himself\\nupon his library, and he was very good to his young tutor, who, he told\\neverybody, was â\\x80\\x9ca lad of genius;â\\x80\\x9d and though naturally, even with all\\nthis, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s existence was not one of unmingled bliss, the change was\\ngood for him. As soon as he had left Ramore he began to look back to it\\nwith longing, as was natural to his years. The sense that he had that\\nhome behind him, with everybody ready to stand by him whatever trouble\\nhe might fall into, and every heart open to hear and sympathize in all\\nthe particulars of his life, restored the young man all at once to\\ncontent and satisfaction with the homely household that loved him. When\\nhe was there life looked gray and sombre in all its sober-coloured\\ngarments; but when he looked across the loch at the white house on the\\nhillside, that little habitation had regained its ideal character. He\\nhad some things to endure, as was natural, that galled his high spirit,\\nbut, on the whole, he was happier than if he had still been at Ramore.\\n\\nAnd so the summer passed on. He had sent his answer to Sir Thomas\\nwithout any delay--an answer in which, on the whole, his father\\nconcurred--written in a strain of lofty politeness which would not have\\nmisbecome a young prince. â\\x80\\x9cHe was destined for the Church of Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d\\nColin wrote, â\\x80\\x9cand such being the case, it was best that he should\\ncontent himself with the training of a Scotch university. Less perfect,\\nno doubt,â\\x80\\x9d the boy had said, with a kind of haughty humility; â\\x80\\x9cbut,\\nperhaps, better adapted to the future occupations of a Scotch\\nclergyman.â\\x80\\x9d And then he went on to offer thanks in a magnificent way,\\ncalculated to overwhelm utterly the good-natured baronet, who had never\\nonce imagined that the pride of the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son would be wounded by his\\nproposal. The answer had been sent, and no notice had been taken of it.\\nIt was months since then, and not a word of Sir Thomas Frankland or his\\nfamily had been heard about the Holy Loch. They seemed to have\\ndisappeared altogether back again into their native firmament, never\\nmore to dazzle the eyes of beholders in the west country. It was hard\\nupon Colin thus to lose, at a stroke, not only the hope on which he had\\nbuilt so securely, but at the same time a great part of the general\\nstimulation of his life. Not only the visionary budding love which had\\nfilled him with so many sweet thoughts, but even the secret rivalry and\\nopposition which no one knew of, had given strength and animation to his\\nlife--and now both seemed to have departed together. He mused over it\\noften with wonder, asking himself if Lauderdale was right; if it was\\ntrue that most things come to nothing; and whether meetings and\\npartings, which looked as if they must tell upon life for ever and ever,\\nwere, after all, of not half so much account as the steady routine of\\nexistence? The youth perplexed himself daily with such questions, and\\nwrote to Lauderdale many a long mysterious epistle which puzzled his\\nanxious friend, who could not make out what had set Colinâ\\x80\\x99s brains\\nastray out of all the confident philosophies of his years. When the\\nyoung man, in his hours of leisure, climbed up the woody ravine close\\nby, to where the burn took long leaps over the rocks, flinging itself\\ndown in diamonds and showers of spray into the heart of the deep summer\\nfoliage in the Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s Glen, and from that height looked down upon the\\ncastle on the other side, seated among its lawns and trees on the soft\\npromontory which narrowed the entrance of the loch, Colin could not but\\nfeel the unexpected void which was suddenly made in his life. The\\nFrankland family had been prominent objects on his horizon for a number\\nof years. In disliking or liking, they had been always before him; and\\neven at his most belligerent period, there was something not\\ndisagreeable to the ladâ\\x80\\x99s fancy, at least, in this link of connexion\\nwith a world so different from his own--a world in which, however\\ncommonplace might be the majority of the actors, such great persons as\\nwere to be had in the age might still be found. And now they had gone\\naltogether away out of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s reach or ken; and he was left in his\\nnatural position nowise affected by his connexion with them. It was a\\nstrange feeling, and notwithstanding the scorn with which he rejected\\nthe baronetâ\\x80\\x99s kindness and declined his patronage, much disappointment\\nand mortification mingled with the sense of surprise in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is all as it ought to be,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself many times as he\\npondered over it; but, perhaps, if it had been quite as he expected, he\\nwould not have needed to impress that sentiment on his mind by so many\\nrepetitions. These reflections still recurred to him all the summer\\nthrough whenever he had any time to himself. But Colinâ\\x80\\x99s time was not\\nmuch at his own disposal. Nature had given to this country lad a\\ncountenance which propitiated the world. Not that it was handsome in the\\nabstract, or could bear examination feature by feature; but there were\\nfew people who could resist the mingled shyness and frankness of the\\neyes with which Colin looked out upon the miraculous universe,\\nperceiving perpetual wonders. The surprise of existence was still in his\\nface, indignant though he would have been had anybody told him so; and\\ntired people of the world, who knew better than they practised, took\\ncomfort in talking to the youth, who, whatever he might choose to say,\\nwas still looking as might be seen, with fresh eyes at the dewy earth,\\nand saw everything through the atmosphere of the morning. This\\nunconscious charm of his told greatly upon women, and most of all upon\\nwomen who were older than himself. The young ladies were not so sure of\\nhim, for his fancy was preoccupied; but he gained many friends among the\\nmatrons whom he encountered, and generally was a popular individual. And\\nthen hospitality reigns paramount on those sweet shores of the Holy\\nLoch. Mr. Jordan filled his handsome house with a continual succession\\nof guests from all quarters; and as neither the host nor hostess was in\\nthe least degree amusing, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s services were in constant requisition.\\nSometimes the company was good, often indifferent; but, at all events,\\nit occupied the youth, and kept him from too much inquisition into the\\nearly troubles of his own career.\\n\\nHis life went on in this fashion until September brought sportsmen in\\nflocks to the heathery braes of the loch. Colin, whose engagement was\\nbut a temporary one, was beginning to look forward once again to his old\\nlife in Glasgow--to the close little room in Donaldsonâ\\x80\\x99s Land, and the\\nlong walks and longer talks with Lauderdale, which were almost his only\\nrecreation. Perhaps the idea was not so agreeable to him as in former\\nyears. Somehow, he was going back with a duller idea of existence, with\\nno radiance of variable light upon his horizon; and in the absence of\\nthat fairy illumination the natural circumstances became more palpable,\\nand struck him with a sense of their poverty and meanness such as he had\\nnever felt before. He had to gulp down a little disgust as he thought of\\nhis attic, and even, in the involuntary fickleness of his youth, was not\\nquite so sure of enjoying Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s philosophy as he had been for all\\nthose bygone years.\\n\\nHe was in this state of mind when he heard of a new party of visitors\\nwho were to arrive the day after at Ardmartin--a distinguished party of\\nvisitors, fine people, whom Mr. Jordan had met somewhere in the world,\\nand who had deigned to forget his lack of rank, and even of interest, in\\nhis wealth, and his grouse, and the convenient situation of his house;\\nfor Colinâ\\x80\\x99s employer was not moderately rich--a condition which does a\\nman no good in society--but had heaps upon heaps of money, or was\\nsupposed to have it, which comes to about the same, and was respected\\naccordingly. Colin listened but languidly to the scraps of talk he heard\\nabout these fine people. There was a dowager countess among them, whose\\nname abstracted the lady of the house from all other considerations. As\\nfor Colin, he was still too young to care for dowagers; he heard without\\nhearing of all the preparations that were to be made, and the exertions\\nthat were thought necessary in order to make Ardmartin agreeable to so\\nillustrious a party, and paid very little attention to anything that was\\ngoing on, hoping within himself to make his escape from the fuss of the\\nreception, and have a little time to himself. On the afternoon on which\\nthey were expected he betook himself to the hills, as soon as his work\\nwith his pupils was over. It had been raining as usual, and everything\\nshone and glistened in the sun, which blazed all over the braes with a\\nbrightness that did not neutralize the chill of the season. The air was\\nso still that Colin heard the crack of the sportsmenâ\\x80\\x99s guns from\\ndifferent points around him, miles apart from each other, and could\\neven, on the height where he stood, make out the throb of the little\\nsteamer which was progressing through the loch at his feet, reflected to\\nthe minutest touch, from its pennon of white steam at the funnel to the\\npatches of colour among its passengers on the deck, in the clear water\\nover which it glided. The young man pursued his walk till the shadows\\nbegan to gather, and the big bell of Ardmartin pealed out its summons to\\ndress into all the echoes as he reached the gate. The house looked\\ncrowded to the very door, where it had overflowed in a margin of\\nservants, some of whom were still unloading the last carriage as Colin\\nentered. He pursued his way to his own room languidly enough, for he was\\ntired, and he was not much interested in anything he personally was\\nlikely to hear or see.\\n\\nBut as he went up the grand staircase, he passed a door which was ajar,\\nand from which came the sound of an animated conversation. Colin started\\nas if he had received a blow, as one of these voices fell on his ear. He\\ncame to a dead pause in the gallery upon which this room opened, and\\nstood listening, unconscious of the surprised looks of somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s maid,\\nwho passed him with her ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dress in her arms, and looked very\\ncuriously at the tutor. Colin stopped short and listened, suddenly\\nroused up to a degree of interest which brought the colour to his cheek\\nand the light to his eye. He thought all the ladies of the party must be\\nthere, so varied was the pleasant din and so many the voices; but he had\\nbeen standing breathless, in the most eager pose of listening, for\\nnearly half the time allowed for dressing, before he heard again the\\nvoice which had arrested him. Then, when he began to imagine that it\\nmust have been a dream, the sound struck his ear once more--a few brief\\nsyllables, a sweet, sudden laugh, and again silence. Was it _her_ voice?\\nor was it only a trick of fancy? While he stood lingering, wondering,\\nstraining his ear for a repetition of the sound, the door opened softly,\\nand various white figures in dressing-gowns flitted off upstairs and\\ndownstairs, some of them uttering little exclamations of fright at sight\\nof the alarming apparition of a man. It was pretty to see them\\ndispersing, like so many white doves, from that momentary confabulation;\\nbut _she_ was not among them. Colin went up to his room and dressed with\\nlightning speed, chafing within himself at the humble place which he was\\nexpected to take at the table. When he went into the dining-room, as\\nusual, all the rest of the party were taking their places. The only\\nwomankind distinctly within Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sight was a lady of fifty, large\\nenough to make six Matildas. He could not see _her_ though he strained\\nhis eyes up and down through the long alley of fruits and flowers.\\nThough he was not twenty, and had walked about ten miles that afternoon\\nover the wholesome heather, the poor young fellow could not eat any\\ndinner. He had been placed beside a heavy old man to amuse him, whom\\nhis employer thought might be useful to the young student; but Colin had\\nnot half a dozen words to spend upon any one. Was _she_ here? or was it\\nmere imagination which brought down to him now and then, through the\\npauses of the conversation, a momentary tone that was like hers? When\\nthe ladies left the room the young man rushed, though it was not his\\noffice, to open the door for them. Another moment and Colin was in\\nparadise--the paradise of fools. How was it possible that he could have\\nbeen deceived? The little start with which she recognised him, the\\nmovement of surprise which made her drop her handkerchief and brought\\nthe colour to her cheek, rapt the lad into a feeling more exquisite than\\nany he had known all his life. She smiled; she gave him a rapid, sweet\\nlook of recognition, which was made complete by that start of surprise.\\nShe was here, under the same roof--she whom he had never hoped to see\\nagain. Colin fell headlong into the unintended snare. He sat pondering\\nover her look and her startled gesture all the tedious time, while the\\nother men drank their wine, without being at all aware what divine\\nelixir was in _his_ cup. Her look of sweet wonder kept shining ever\\nbrighter and brighter before his imagination. Was it wonder only, or\\nsome dawning of another sentiment? If she had spoken, the spell might\\nhave been less powerful. A crowd of fairy voices kept whispering all\\nmanner of delicious follies in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ear, as he sat waiting for the\\nmoment when he could follow her. Imagination did everything for him in\\nthat moment of expectation and unlooked-for delight.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\n\\nMr. Jordan had invited a large party of people to meet the Dowager\\nCountess; but the greatness of the leading light, which was to\\nillustrate his house, had blinded him to the companion stars that were\\nto twinkle in her company. The principal people about had consented\\ngraciously to be reviewed by her ladyship, who, once upon a time, had\\nbeen a very great lady and fashionable potentate. A very little fashion\\ncounts for much on the shores of the Holy Loch, and the population was\\nmoved accordingly. But the young ladies, who accompanied the dowager,\\nwere less carefully provided for. When Miss Frankland, who was\\nunquestionably the beauty of the party, cast a glance of careless but\\nacute observation round her, after all the gentlemen had returned to the\\ndrawing-room, she saw nobody whom she cared to distinguish by her\\nnotice. Most of the men about had a flavour of commerciality in their\\ntalk, or their manner, or their whiskers. Most of them were rich, some\\nof them were very well bred and well educated, though the saucy beauty\\ncould not perceive it; but there was not an individual among them who\\nmoved her curiosity or her interest, except one who stood rather in the\\nbackground, and whose eyes kept seeking her with wistful devotion.\\n\\nColin had improved during the last year. He was younger than Miss\\nFrankland, a fact of which she was aware, and he was at the age upon\\nwhich a year tells mightily. Looking at him in the background, through\\nclouds of complacent people who felt themselves Colinâ\\x80\\x99s superiors, even\\nan indifferent spectator might have distinguished the tall youth, with\\nthose heaps of brown hair overshadowing the forehead which might have\\nbeen apostrophized as â\\x80\\x9cdomed for thoughtâ\\x80\\x9d if anybody could have seen it;\\nand in his eyes that gleam of things miraculous, that unconscious\\nsurprise and admiration which would have given a touch of poetry to the\\nmost commonplace countenance. But Miss Matty was not an indifferent\\nspectator. She was fond of him in her way as women are fond of a man\\nwhom they never mean to love--fond of him as one is fond of the victim\\nwho consents to glorify oneâ\\x80\\x99s triumph. As she looked at him, and saw how\\nhe had improved, and perceived the faithful allegiance with which he\\nwatched every movement she made, the heart of the beauty was touched.\\nWorship is sweet, even when it is only a country boy who bestows it--and\\nperhaps this country boy might turn out a genius or a poet. Not that\\nMatilda cared much for genius or poetry, but she liked everything which\\nbestows distinction, and was aware that in the lack of other titles, a\\nlittle notability, even in society, might be obtained if one was wise,\\nand knew how to manage it, even by such means. And besides all this,\\nhonestly and at the foundation, she was fond of Colin. When she had\\nsurveyed all the company, and had made up her mind that there was nobody\\nthere in the least degree interesting, she held up her fan with a pretty\\ngesture, calling him to her. The lad made his way through the assembly\\nat that call with a smile and glow of exultation which it is impossible\\nto describe. His face was lighted up with a kind of celestial\\nintoxication. â\\x80\\x9cWho is that very handsome young man?â\\x80\\x9d the Dowager\\nCountess was moved to remark as he passed within her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s range of\\nvision, which was limited, for Lady Hallamshire was, like most other\\npeople, shortsighted. â\\x80\\x9cOh, he is not a handsome young man, he is only\\nthe tutor,â\\x80\\x9d said one of the ladies of the Holy Loch; but,\\nnotwithstanding, she too looked after Colin, with aroused curiosity. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nsuppose Matty Frankland must have met him in society,â\\x80\\x9d said the Dowager,\\nwho was the most comfortable of _chaperones_, and went on with her talk,\\nturning her eyeglass towards her pretty charge. As for the young men,\\nthey stared at Colin with mingled consternation and wrath. What was he?\\na fellow who had not a penny, a mere Scotch student, to be distinguished\\nby the prettiest girl in the room? for the aspiring people about the\\nHoly Loch, as well as in the other parts of Scotland, had come to\\nentertain that contempt for the national universities and national\\nscholarship which is so curious a feature in the present transition\\nstate of the country. If Colin had been an Oxford man the west-country\\npeople would have thought it quite natural, but a Scotch student did not\\nimpress them with any particular respect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am so glad to meet you again!â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, with the warmest\\ncordiality, â\\x80\\x9cbut so surprised to see you here. What are you doing here?\\nwhy have you come away from that delicious Ramore, where I am sure I\\nshould live for ever and ever if it were mine? What have you been doing\\nwith yourself all this time? Come and tell me all about it; and I do so\\nwant to know how everything is looking at that dear castle and in our\\nfavourite glen. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you remember that darling glen behind the church,\\nwhere we used to gather basketfuls of primroses--and all the lovely\\nmosses? I am dying to hear about everything and everybody. Do come and\\nsit down here, and tell me all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere shall I begin?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who, utterly forgetful of his\\nposition, and all the humilities incumbent on him in such an exalted\\ncompany, had instantly taken possession of the seat she pointed out to\\nhim, and had placed himself according to her orders directly between her\\nand the company, shutting her into a corner. Miss Matty could see very\\nwell all that was going on in the drawing-room, but Colin had his back\\nto the company, and had forgotten everything in the world except her\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, with yourself, of course,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty. â\\x80\\x9cI want to know all about\\nit; and, first of all, what are you doing among these sort of people?â\\x80\\x9d\\nthe young lady continued, with a little nod of her head towards the\\nassembled multitude, some of whom were quite within hearing.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese sort of people have very little to say to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who\\nsuddenly felt himself elevated over their heads; â\\x80\\x9cI am only the tutor;â\\x80\\x9d\\nand the two foolish young creatures looked at each other, and laughed,\\nas if Colin of Ramore had been a prince in disguise, and his tutorship\\nan excellent joke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you are only the tutor?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty--â\\x80\\x9cthat is charming. Then\\none will be able to make all sorts of use of you. Everybody is allowed\\nto maltreat a tutor. You will have to row us on the loch, and walk with\\nus to the glen, and carry our cloaks, and generally conduct yourself as\\nbecomes a slave and vassal. As for me, I shall order you about with the\\ngreatest freedom, and expect perfect obedience,â\\x80\\x9d said the beauty,\\nlooking with her eyes full of laughter into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll that goes without saying,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who did not like to commit\\nhimself to the French. â\\x80\\x9cI almost think I have already proved my perfect\\nallegiance.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you were only a boy last year,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with some\\nevanescent change of colour, which looked like a blush to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndelighted eyes. â\\x80\\x9cNow you are a man and a tutor, and we shall behave to\\nyou accordingly. How lovely that glen was last spring, to be sure,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued the girl, with a little quite unconscious natural feeling; â\\x80\\x9cdo\\nyou remember the day when it rained, and we had to wait under the\\nbeeches, and when you imagined all sorts of things in the pattering of\\nthe shower? Do you ever write any poetry now? I want so much to see what\\nyou have been doing--since--â\\x80\\x9d said the siren, who, half-touched by\\nnature in her own person, was still perfectly conscious of her power.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSince!â\\x80\\x9d Colin repeated the word over to himself with a flush of\\nhappiness which, perhaps, no real good in existence could have equalled.\\nPoor boy! if he could but have known what had happened â\\x80\\x9csinceâ\\x80\\x9d in Miss\\nMattyâ\\x80\\x99s experience--but, fortunately, he had not the smallest idea what\\nwas involved in the season which the young lady had lately terminated,\\nor in the brilliant winter campaign in the country, which had brought\\nadorers in plenty, but nothing worthy of the beautyâ\\x80\\x99s acceptance, to\\nMiss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s feet. Colin thought only of the beatific dreams, the\\nfaithful follies which had occupied his own juvenile imagination\\nâ\\x80\\x9csince.â\\x80\\x9d As for the heroine herself, she looked slightly confused to\\nhear him repeat the word. She had meant it to produce its effect, but\\nthen she was thinking solely of a male creature of her own species, and\\nnot of a primitive, innocent soul like that which looked at her in a\\nglow of young delight out of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. She was used to be admired\\nand complimented, and humoured to the top of her bent, but she did not\\nunderstand being believed in, and the new sensation somewhat flattered\\nand embarrassed the young woman of the world. She watched his look, as\\nhe replied to her, and thereby added doubly, though she did not mean it,\\nto the effect of what she had said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never write poetry,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cI wish I could--I know how I should\\nuse the gift; but I have a few verses about somewhere, I suppose, like\\neverybody else. Last spring I was almost persuaded I could do something\\nbetter; but that feeling lasts only so long as oneâ\\x80\\x99s inspiration lasts,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the youth, looking down, in his turn, lest his meaning might be\\ndiscovered too quickly in his eye.\\n\\nAnd then there ensued a pause--a pause which was more dangerous than the\\ntalk, and which Miss Matty made haste to break.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know you are very much changed?â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cYou never did any of\\nthis society-talk last year. You have been making friends with some\\nladies somewhere, and they have taught you conversation. But, as for me,\\nI am your early friend, and I preferred you when you did not talk like\\nother people,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with a slight pout. â\\x80\\x9cTell me who has\\nbeen forming your mind?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPerhaps it was fortunate for Colin at this moment that Lady Hallamshire\\nhad become much bored by the group which had gathered round her sofa.\\nThe dowager was clever in her way, and had written a novel or two, and\\nwas accustomed to be amused by the people who had the honour of talking\\nto her. Though she was no longer a leader of fashion, she kept up the\\nmanners and customs of that remarkable species of the human race, and\\nwhen she was bored, permitted her sentiments to be plainly visible in\\nher expressive countenance. Though it was the member for the county who\\nwas enlightening her at that moment in the statistics of the West\\nHighlands, and though she had been in a state of great anxiety five\\nminutes before about the emigration which was depopulating the moors,\\nher ladyship broke in quite abruptly in the midst of the poor-rates with\\na totally irrelevant observation--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appears to me that Matty Frankland has got into another flirtation;\\nI must go and look after her,â\\x80\\x9d said the Dowager; and she smiled\\ngraciously upon the explanatory member, and left him talking, to the\\nutter consternation of their hostess. Lady Hallamshire thought it\\nprobable that the young man was amusing as well as handsome, or Matty\\nFrankland, who was a girl of discretion, would not have received him\\ninto such marked favour. â\\x80\\x9cThough I daresay there is nobody here worth\\nher trouble,â\\x80\\x9d her chaperone thought as she looked round the room; but\\nanyhow a change was desirable. â\\x80\\x9cMatty, mignonne, I want to know what you\\nare talking about,â\\x80\\x9d she said, suddenly coming to anchor opposite the two\\nyoung people; and a considerable fuss ensued to find her ladyship a\\nseat, during which time Colin had a hundred minds to run away. The\\ncompany took a new centre after this performance on the part of the\\ngreat lady, and poor Colin, all at once, began to feel that he was doing\\nexactly the reverse of what was expected of him. He got up with a\\npainful blush as he met Mr. Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s astonished eye. The poor boy did\\nnot know that he had been much more remarked before: â\\x80\\x9cflirting openly\\nwith that dreadful little coquette Miss Frankland, and turning his back\\nupon his superiors,â\\x80\\x9d as some of the indignant bystanders said. Even\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s matronly friends, who pitied him and formed his mind,\\ndisapproved of his behaviour. â\\x80\\x9cShe only means to make a fool of you, and\\nyou ought not to allow yourself to be taken in by it,â\\x80\\x9d said one of these\\npatronesses in his ear, calling him aside. But Fate had determined\\notherwise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t go away,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Hallamshire. â\\x80\\x9cI like Matty to introduce all\\nher friends to me; and you two look as if you had known each other a\\nlong time,â\\x80\\x9d said the dowager, graciously; for she was pleased, like most\\nwomen, by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s looks. â\\x80\\x9cOne would know him again if one met him,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nadded, in an audible aside; â\\x80\\x9che doesnâ\\x80\\x99t look exactly like everybody\\nelse, as most young men do. Who is he, Matty?â\\x80\\x9d And Miss Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s\\n_chaperone_ turned the light of her countenance full upon Colin, quite\\nindifferent to the fact that he had heard one part of her speech quite\\nas well as the other. When a fine lady consents to enter the outer\\nworld, it is to be expected that she should behave herself as civilized\\npeople do among savages, and the English among the other nations of the\\nworld.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes! we have known each other a long time,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, partly with\\na generous, partly with a mischievous, instinct. â\\x80\\x9cMy uncle knows Mr.\\nCampbellâ\\x80\\x99s father very well, and Harry and he and I made acquaintance\\nwhen we were children. I am sure you must have heard how nearly Harry\\nwas drowned once when we were at Kilchurn Castle. It was Mr. Campbell\\nwho saved his life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh!â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Hallamshire; â\\x80\\x9cbut I thought that wasâ\\x80\\x9d--and then she\\nstopped short. Looking at Colin again, her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s experienced eye\\nperceived that he was not arrayed with that perfection of apparel to\\nwhich she was accustomed; but at the same moment her eye caught his\\nglowing face, half pleased, half haughty with that pride of lowliness\\nwhich is of all pride the most defiant. â\\x80\\x9cI am very glad to make Mr.\\nCampbellâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance,â\\x80\\x9d--she went on so graciously that everybody\\nforgot the pause. â\\x80\\x9cHarry Frankland is a very dear young friend of mine,\\nand we are all very much indebted to his deliverer.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was just what a distinguished matron would have said in the\\ncircumstances in one of Lady Hallamshireâ\\x80\\x99s novels; but, instead of\\nremaining overcome with grateful confusion, as the hero ought to have\\ndone, Colin made an immediate reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI cannot take the credit people give me,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, with a little\\nheat. â\\x80\\x9cHe happened to get into my boat when he was nearly\\nexhausted--that is the whole business. There has been much more talk\\nabout it than was necessary. I cannot pretend even to be a friend of Mr.\\nFrankland,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with the unnecessary explanatoriness of youth,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand I certainly did not save his life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith which speech the young man disappeared out of sight amid the\\nwondering assembly, which privately designated him a young puppy and a\\nyoung prig, and by various other epithets, according to the individual\\nmind of the speaker. As for Lady Hallamshire, she was considerably\\ndisgusted. â\\x80\\x9cYour friend is original, I dare say; but I am not sure that\\nhe is quite civil,â\\x80\\x9d she said to Matty, who did not quite know whether to\\nbe vexed or pleased by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s abrupt withdrawal. Perhaps on the whole\\nthe young lady liked him better for having a mind of his own,\\nnotwithstanding his devotion, and for preferring to bestow his worship\\nwithout the assistance of spectators. If he had been a man in the least\\neligible as a lover, Miss Frankland might have been of a different\\nopinion; but, as that was totally out of possibility, Matty liked, on\\nthe whole, that he should do what was ideally right, and keep up her\\nconception of him. She gave her head a pretty toss of semi-defiance, and\\nwent across the room to Mrs. Jordan, to whom she was very amiable and\\ncaressing all the rest of the evening. But she still continued to watch\\nwith the corner of her eye the tall boyish figure which was now and then\\nto be discerned in the distance, with those masses of brown hair heaped\\nlike clouds upon the forehead, which Colinâ\\x80\\x99s height made visible over\\nthe heads of many very superior people. She knew he was watching her\\nand noted every movement she made, and she felt a little proud of the\\nslave, who, though he was only the tutor and a poor farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son, had\\nsomething in his eyes which nobody else within sight had any inkling of.\\nMatty was rather clever in her way, which was as much different from\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s as light from darkness. No man of a mental calibre like hers\\ncould have found him out; but she had a little insight, as a woman,\\nwhich enabled her to perceive the greater height when she came within\\nsight of it. And then poor Colin, all unconsciously, had given her such\\nan advantage over him. He had laid his boyâ\\x80\\x99s heart at her feet, and,\\nhalf in love, half in imagination, had made her the goddess of his\\nyouth. If she had thought it likely to do him any serious damage,\\nperhaps Matty, who was a good girl enough, and was of some use to the\\nrector and very popular among the poor in her own parish, might have\\ndone her duty by Colin, and crushed this pleasant folly in the bud. But\\nthen it did not occur to her that a â\\x80\\x9cfriendshipâ\\x80\\x9d of which it was so very\\nevident nothing could ever come, could harm anybody. It did not occur to\\nher that an ambitious Scotch boy, who knew no more of the world than a\\nbaby, and who had been fed upon all the tales of riches achieved and\\nglories won which are the common fare of many a homely household, might\\npossibly entertain a different opinion. So Matty asked all kinds of\\nquestions about him of Mrs. Jordan, and gave him now and then a little\\nnod when she met his eye, and generally kept up a kind of special\\nintercourse far more flattering to the youth than ordinary conversation.\\nPoor Colin neither attempted nor wished to defend himself. He put his\\nhead under the yoke, and hugged his chains. He collected his verses,\\npoor boy! when he went to his own room that night--verses which he knew\\nvery well were true to her, but in which it would be rather difficult to\\nexplain the fatal stroke--the grievous blow on which he had expatiated\\nso vaguely that it might be taken to mean the death of his lady rather\\nthan the simple fact that she did not come to Kilchurn Castle when he\\nexpected her. How to make her understand that this was the object of his\\nlamentations puzzled him a little; for Colin knew enough of romance to\\nbe aware that the true lover does not venture to address the princess\\nuntil he has so far conquered fortune as to make his suit with honour to\\nher and fitness in the eyes of the world.\\n\\nIt was thus that the young tutor sat in his bare little room out of the\\nway, and, with eyes that glowed over his midnight candle, looked into\\nthe future, and calculated visionary dates at which, if all went with\\nhim as he hoped, he might lay his trophies at his ladyâ\\x80\\x99s feet. It is\\ntrue that Matty herself fully intended by that time to have daughters\\nready to enter upon the round of conquest from which she should have\\nretired into matron dignity; but no such profanity ever occurred to\\nColin. Thus the two thought of each other as they went to their\\nrest--the one with all the delusions of heroic youthful love, the other\\nwith no delusions at all, but a half gratitude, half affection--a\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s compassionate fondness for the man who had touched her heart a\\nlittle by giving her his, but whom it was out of the question ever to\\nthink of loving. And so the coils of Fate began to throw themselves\\naround the free-born feet of young Colin of Ramore.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\n\\nLady Hallamshire was a woman very accessible to a little judicious\\nflattery, and very sensible of good living. She liked Mr. Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s\\nliberal house, and she liked the court that was paid to her; and was not\\naverse to lengthening out her visit, and converting three days into a\\nfortnight, especially as her ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s youngest son, Horace\\nFitz-Gibbon, who was a lieutenant in the navy, was expected daily in the\\nClyde--at least his ship was, which comes to the same thing. Horace was\\na dashing young fellow enough, with nothing but his handsome face (he\\nhad his motherâ\\x80\\x99s nose, as everybody acknowledged, and, although now a\\ndowager, she had been a great beauty in her day), and the honourable\\nprefix to his name to help him on in the world. Lady Hallamshire had\\nheard of an heiress or two about, and her maternal ambition was\\nstimulated; and, at the same time, the grouse were bewitching, and the\\ncookery most creditable. The only thing she was sorry for was Matty\\nFrankland, her ladyship said, who never could stay more than a week\\nanywhere, unless she was flirting with somebody, without being bored.\\nPerhaps the necessary conditions had been obtained even at Ardmartin,\\nfor Matty bore up very well on the whole. She fulfilled the threat of\\nmaking use of the tutor to the fullest extent; and Colin gave himself up\\nto the enjoyment of his foolâ\\x80\\x99s paradise without a thought of flying from\\nthe dangerous felicity. They climbed the hills together, keeping far in\\nadvance of their companions, who overtook them only to find the mood\\nchange, and to leave behind in the descent the pair of loiterers, whose\\npace no calls nor advices, nor even the frequent shower, could quicken;\\nand they rowed together over the lovely loch, about which Matty, having\\nmuch fluency of language, and the adroitness of a little woman of the\\nworld in appropriating other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments, showed even more\\nenthusiasm than Colin. Perhaps she too enjoyed this wonderful holiday in\\nthe life which already she knew by heart, and found no novelty in. To be\\nadored, to be invested with all the celestial attributes, to feel\\nherself the one grand object in somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s world, is pleasant to a\\nwoman. Matty almost felt as if she was in love, without the\\nresponsibility of the thing, or any need for troubling herself about\\nwhat it was going to come to. It could come to nothing--except an\\nexpression of gratitude and kindness to the young man who had saved her\\ncousinâ\\x80\\x99s life. When everything was so perfectly safe, there could be no\\nharm in the enjoyment; and the conclusion Matty came to, as an\\nexperimental philosopher, was, that to fall in love really, and to\\naccept its responsibilities, would be an exciting but highly troublesome\\namusement. She could not help thinking to herself how anxious she should\\nbe about Colin if such a thing were possible. How those mistakes which\\nhe could not help making, and which at present did not disturb her in\\nthe least, would make her glow and burn with shame, if he were really\\nanything to her. And yet he was a great deal to her. She was as good as\\nif she had been really possessed by that love on which she speculated,\\nand almost as happy; and Colin was in her mind most of the hours of the\\nday, when she was awake, and a few of those in which she slept. The\\ndifference was, that Matty contemplated quite calmly the inevitable fact\\nof leaving Ardmartin on Monday, and did not think it in the least likely\\nthat she would break her heart over the parting; and that, even in\\nimagination, she never for a moment connected her fate with that of her\\nyoung adorer.\\n\\nBut as for the poor youth himself, he went deeper and deeper into the\\nenchanted land. He went without any resistance, giving himself up to the\\nsweet fate. She had read the poems of course, and had inquired eagerly\\ninto that calamity which occupied so great a part in them, and had found\\nout what it was, and had blushed (as Colin thought), but was not angry.\\nWhat could a shy young lover, whose lips were sealed by honour, but who\\nknew his eyes, his actions, his productions to be alike eloquent, desire\\nmore? Sometimes Lady Hallamshire consented to weigh down the boat,\\nwhich dipped hugely at the stern under her, and made Colinâ\\x80\\x99s task a hard\\none. Sometimes the tutor, who counted for nobody, was allowed to conduct\\na cluster of girls, of whom he saw but one, over the peaceful water.\\nLessons did not count for much in those paradisaical days. Miss\\nFrankland begged holidays for the boys; begged that they might go\\nexcursions with her, and make pic-nics on the hill-side, and accompany\\nher to all sorts of places, till Mrs. Jordan was entirely captivated\\nwith Matty. She never saw a young lady so taken up with children, the\\nexcellent woman said; and prophesied that Miss Matty would make a\\nwonderful mother of a family when her time came. As for the tutor, Mrs.\\nJordan too took him for a cipher, and explained to him how improving it\\nwas for the boys to be in good society, by way of apologizing to Colin.\\nAt length there occurred one blessed day in which Colin and his boys\\nembarked with Miss Frankland alone, to row across to Ramore. â\\x80\\x9cMy uncle\\nhas so high an opinion of Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d Matty said very demurely; â\\x80\\x9cI\\nknow he would never forgive me if I did not go to see him.â\\x80\\x9d As for\\nColin, his blessedness was tempered on that particular occasion by a\\nless worthy feeling. He felt, if not ashamed of Ramore, at least,\\napologetic of it and its accessories, which apology took, as was natural\\nto a Scotch lad of his years, an argumentative and defiant tone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is a poor house enough,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, as he pointed it out, gleaming\\nwhite upon the hill-side, to Miss Matty, who pretended to remember it\\nperfectly, but who after all had not the least idea which was\\nRamore--â\\x80\\x9cbut I would not change with anybody I know. We are better off\\nin the cottages than you in the palaces. Comfort is a poor sort of\\nheathen deity to be worshipped as you worship him in England. As for us,\\nwe have a higher standard,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, half in sport and more than\\nhalf in earnest. The two young Jordans after a little gaping at the talk\\nwhich went over their heads (for Miss Matty was wonderfully taken up\\nwith the children only when their mother was present), had betaken\\nthemselves to the occupation of sailing a little yacht from the bows of\\ntheir boat, and were very well-behaved and disturbed nobody.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, in an absent tone. â\\x80\\x9cBy the way, I wish very much you\\nwould tell me why you rejected my uncleâ\\x80\\x99s proposal about going to\\nOxford. I suppose you _have_ a higher standard; but then they say you\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t have such good scholars in Scotland. I am sure I beg your pardon\\nif I am wrong.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I did not say you were wrong,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who, however, grew fiery\\nred, and burned to prove his scholarship equal to that of any Eton lad\\nor Christ-church man. â\\x80\\x9cThey say, on the other side, that a man may get\\nthrough without disgrace, in Oxford or Cambridge, who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know how\\nto spell English,â\\x80\\x9d said the youth, with natural exasperation--and took a\\nfew long strokes which sent the boat flying across the summer ripples,\\nand consumed his angry energy. He was quite ready to sneer at Scotch\\nscholarship in his own person, when he and his fellows were together,\\nand even to sigh over the completer order and profounder studies of the\\ngreat Universities of England; but to acknowledge the inferiority of his\\ncountry in any particular to the lady of his wishes, was beyond the\\nvirtue of a Scotchman and a lover.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not speak of stupid people,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty; â\\x80\\x9cand I am sure I\\ndid not mean to vex you. Of course I know you are so very clever in\\nScotland; everybody allows _that_. I love Scotland so much,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\npolitic little woman; â\\x80\\x9cbut then every country has its weak points and\\nits strong points; and you have not told me yet why you rejected my\\nuncleâ\\x80\\x99s proposal. He wished you very much to accept it; and so did I,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the siren, after a little pause, lifting upon Colin the\\nhalf-subdued light of her blue eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy did you wish it?â\\x80\\x9d the lad asked, as was to be expected, bending\\nforward to hear the answer to his question.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, look there! little Ben will be overboard in another minute,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMatty, and then she continued lower, â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t tell you, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure;\\nbecause I thought you were going to turn out a great genius, I suppose.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe _that_?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cyou say so only to make the\\nHoly Loch a little more like Paradise; and that is unnecessary to-day,â\\x80\\x9d\\nthe lad went on, glancing round him with eyes full of the light that\\nnever was on sea or land. Though he was not a poet, he had what was\\nalmost better, a poetic soul. The great world moved for him always amid\\neverlasting melodies, the morning and the evening stars singing together\\neven through the common day. Just now his cup was about running over.\\nWhat if, to crown all, God, not content with giving him life and love,\\nhad indeed visibly to the sight of others, if not to his own, bestowed\\ngenius also, the other gift most prized of youth. Somehow, he could not\\ncontradict that divine peradventure, â\\x80\\x9cIf it were so,â\\x80\\x9d he said under his\\nbreath, â\\x80\\x9cif it were so!â\\x80\\x9d and the other little soul opposite, who had\\nlost sight of Colin at that moment, and did not know through what\\nbright mists he was wandering, strained her limited vision after him,\\nand wondered and asked what he meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it were so,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, â\\x80\\x9cwhat then?â\\x80\\x9d Most likely she expected a\\ncompliment--and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s compliments being made only by inference, and\\nwith a shyness and an emotion unknown to habitual manufacturers of such\\narticles, were far from being unpleasant offerings to Miss Matty, who\\nwas slightly _blasÃ©_ of the common coin.\\n\\nBut Colin only shook his head, and bent his strong young frame to the\\noars, and shook back the clouds of brown hair from his half-visible\\nforehead. The boat flew like a swallow along the crisp bosom of the\\nloch. Miss Matty did not quite know what to make of the silence, not\\nbeing in love. She took off her glove and held her pretty hand in the\\nwater over the side of the boat, but the loch was cold, and she withdrew\\nit presently. What was he thinking of, she wondered? Having lost sight\\nof him thus, she was reluctant to begin the conversation anew, lest she\\nmight perhaps say something which would betray her non-comprehension,\\nand bring her down from that pedestal which, after all, it was pleasant\\nto occupy. Feminine instinct at last suggested to Matty what was the\\nvery best thing to do in the circumstances. She had a pretty voice, and\\nperfect ease in the use of it, and knew exactly what she could do, as\\npeople of limited powers generally can. So she began to sing, murmuring\\nto herself at first as she stooped over the water, and then rising into\\nfull voice. As for Colin, that last touch was almost too much for him;\\nhe had never heard her sing before, and he could not help marvelling as\\nhe looked at her why Providence should have lavished such endowments\\nupon one, and left so many others unprovided--and fell to rowing softly,\\ndropping his oars into the sunshine with as little sound as possible, to\\ndo full justice to the song. When Matty had come to the end she turned\\non him quite abruptly, and, almost before the last note had died from\\nher lips, repeated her question. â\\x80\\x9cNow tell me why did you refuse to go\\nto Oxford?â\\x80\\x9d said the little siren, looking full into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause I canâ\\x80\\x99t be dependent upon any man, and because I had done\\nnothing to entitle me to such a recompense,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was taken\\nby surprise; â\\x80\\x9cyou all make a mistake about that business,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with\\na slight sudden flush of colour, and immediately fell to his oars again\\nwith all his might.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very odd,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matilda. â\\x80\\x9cWhy donâ\\x80\\x99t you like Harry? He is\\nnothing particular, but he is a very good sort of boy, and it is so\\nstrange that you should have such a hatred to each other--I mean to say,\\n_he_ is not at all fond of _you_,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, with a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nbelieve he is jealous because we all talk of you so much; and it must be\\nrather hard upon a boy after all to have his life _saved_, and to be\\nexpected to be grateful; for I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe a word you say,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\nMatty. â\\x80\\x9cI know the rights of it better than you do--you _did_ save his\\nlife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you will quite release him from the duty of being grateful,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose there is either love or hatred between us.\\nWe donâ\\x80\\x99t know each other to speak of, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t see any reason why we\\nshould be fond of each other;â\\x80\\x9d and again Colin sent the boat forward\\nwith long, rapid strokes, getting rid of the superfluous energy which\\nwas roused within by hearing Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s name.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very odd,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty again. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder if you are fated to be\\nrivals, and come in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s way. If I knew any girl that Harry was\\nin love with, I should not like to introduce you to her,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\nMatty, and she stopped and laughed a little, evidently at something in\\nher own mind. â\\x80\\x9cHow odd it would be if you were to be rivals through\\nlife,â\\x80\\x9d she continued; â\\x80\\x9cI am sure I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell which I should most wish\\nto win--my cousin, who is a very good boy in his way, or you, who puzzle\\nme so often,â\\x80\\x9d said the little witch, looking suddenly up into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\neyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow is it possible I can puzzle you?â\\x80\\x9d he said; but the innocent youth\\nwas flattered by the sense of superiority involved. â\\x80\\x9cThere can be very\\nlittle rivalry between an English baronet and a Scotch minister,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWe shall never come in each otherâ\\x80\\x99s way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd _must_ you be a Scotch minister?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, softly. There\\nwas a regretful tone in her voice, and she gave an appealing glance at\\nhim, as if she were remonstrating against that necessity. Perhaps it was\\nwell for Colin that they were so near the shore, and that he had to give\\nall his attention to the boat, to secure the best landing for those\\ndelicate little feet. As he leaped ashore himself, ankle-deep into the\\nbright but cold water, Colin could not but remember his boyish scorn of\\nHenry Frankland, and that dislike of wet feet which was so amusing and\\nwonderful to the country boy. Matters were wonderfully changed\\nnow-a-days for Colin; but still he plunged into the water with a certain\\nrelish, and pulled the boat ashore with a sense of his strength and\\ndelight in it which at such a moment it was sweet to experience. As for\\nMiss Matty, she found the hill very steep, and accepted the assistance\\nof Colinâ\\x80\\x99s arm to get over the sharp pebbles of the beach. â\\x80\\x9cOne ought to\\nwear strong boots,â\\x80\\x9d she said, holding out the prettiest little foot,\\nwhich indeed had been perfectly revealed before by the festooned dress,\\nwhich Miss Matty found so convenient on the hills. When Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother\\nsaw from her window this pair approaching alone (for the Jordan boys\\nwere ever so far behind, still coquetting with their toy yacht), it was\\nnot wonderful if her heart beat more quickly than usual. She jumped,\\nwith her womanish imagination, at all kinds of incredible results, and\\nsaw her Colin happy and great, by some wonderful conjunction of his own\\ngenius and the favour of others, which it would have been hopeless to\\nattempt any comprehension of. The mistress altogether puzzled and\\noverwhelmed Miss Matty by the greeting she gave her. The little woman of\\nthe world looked in utter amazement at the poor farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife, whom she\\nmeant to be very kind and amiable to, but who to her consternation, took\\nthe superior part by right of nature; for Mrs. Campbell, being possessed\\nby her own idea, was altogether obtuse to her visitorâ\\x80\\x99s condescensions.\\nThe parlour at Ramore looked dingy certainly after the drawing-rooms of\\nArdmartin, and all the business of the farm was manifestly going on as\\nusual; but even Colin, sensitive as he had become to all the differences\\nof circumstances, was puzzled, like Matty, and felt his mother to have\\nsuddenly developed into a kind of primitive princess. Perhaps the poor\\nboy guessed why, and felt that his love was elevating not only himself\\nbut everybody who belonged to him; but Miss Matty, who did not\\nunderstand how profound emotion could affect anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s manners, nor how\\nher young admirerâ\\x80\\x99s mother could be influenced by his sentiments, was\\nentirely in the dark, and could not help being immensely impressed by\\nthe bearing and demeanour of the mistress of Ramore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad itâ\\x80\\x99s such a bonny day,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother; â\\x80\\x9cit looks natural\\nand seemly to see you here on a day like this. As for Colin, he aye\\nbrings the light with him, but no often such sunshine as you. I canna\\nlay any great feast before you,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife with a smile,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut young things like you are aye near enough heaven to be pleased with\\nthe common mercies. After aâ\\x80\\x99, if I was a queen I couldna offer you\\nanything better than the white bread and the fresh milk,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nmistress; and she set down on the table, with her own tender hands, the\\nscones for which Ramore was famous, and the abundant over-running jug\\nof milk, which was not to be surpassed anywhere, as she said. Matty sat\\ndown with an odd involuntary conviction that Mr. Jordanâ\\x80\\x99s magnificent\\ntable on the other side of the loch offered but a poor hospitality in\\ncomparison. Though she laughed at herself an hour after, it was quite\\nimpossible at that moment to feel otherwise than respectful. â\\x80\\x9cI never\\nsaw anybody with such beautiful manners,â\\x80\\x9d she said to Colin as they went\\nback to the boat. She did not take his arm this time, but walked very\\ndemurely after him down the narrow path, feeling upon her the eyes of\\nthe mistress, who was standing at her door as usual to see her son go\\naway. Matty could not help a little natural awe of the woman whose soft\\neyes were watching her. She could manage her aunt perfectly, and did not\\ncare in the least for Lady Hallamshire, who was the most accommodating\\nof chaperones, but Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s sweet looks, and generous reception\\nof her sonâ\\x80\\x99s enslaver somehow overwhelmed Matty. The mistress looked at\\nthe girl as if she considered her capable of all the grand and simple\\nemotions which were in her own heart, and Matty was half-ashamed and\\nhalf-frightened, and did not feel able at the moment to pursue her usual\\namusement. The row back, to which Colin had been looking with a thrill\\nof expectation, was silent and grave, in comparison with all their\\nformer expeditions, notwithstanding that this was the last time they\\nwere likely to see each other alone. Poor Colin thought of Lauderdale\\nand his philosophy, for the first time for many days, when he had to\\nstop behind to place the boat in safety on the beach, while Matty, who\\ngenerally waited for him, skipped up the avenue as fast as she could go,\\nwith the little Jordans beside her. Never yet was reality which came\\ntruly up to the expectation. Here was an end of his foolâ\\x80\\x99s paradise; he\\nvexed himself by going over and over all that had passed, wondering if\\nanything had offended her; and then thought of Ramore with a pang at his\\nheart--a pang of something nobler than the mere bitterness of contrast,\\nwhich sometimes makes a poor man ashamed of his home. But all this time\\nthe true reason for her new-born reserve--which Miss Matty kept up\\nvictoriously until about the close of the evening, when, being utterly\\nbored, she forgot her good resolution and called him to her side\\nagain--was quite unsuspected by Colin. He could not divine how\\nsusceptible to the opinion of women was the heart of a woman, even when\\nit retained but little of its first freshness. Matty was not startled by\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s love, but she was by his motherâ\\x80\\x99s belief in it and herself; it\\nstopped her short in her careless career, and suggested endings that\\nwere not pleasant to think of. If she had been kept in amusement for a\\nday or two after, it might have been well for Colin--but being bored she\\nreturned to her natural sport, and this interruption did him no good in\\nthe end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\n\\nThe parting of the two who had been thrown so much together, who had\\nthought so much of each other, and who had, notwithstanding, so few\\nthings in common, was as near an absolute parting as is practicable in\\nthis world of constant commotion, where everybody meets everybody else\\nin the most unlikely regions. Colin dared not propose to write to her;\\ndared not, indeed--being withheld by the highest impulses of\\nhonour--venture to say to her what was in his heart; and Miss Matty\\nherself was a little silent--perhaps a little moved--and could not utter\\nany commonplaces about meeting again, as she had intended to do. So they\\nsaid good-bye to each other in a kind of absolute way, as if it might be\\nfor ever and ever. As for Matty, who was not in love, but whose heart\\nwas touched, and who had a vague, instinctive sense that she might never\\nmore meet anybody in her life like this country lad--perhaps she had\\nenough generosity left in her to feel that it would be best they should\\nnot meet again. But Colin had no such thoughts. He felt in his heart\\nthat one time--how or when he knew not--he should yet go to her feet and\\noffer what he had to offer: everything else in the world except that one\\nthing was doubtful to Colin, but concerning that he was confident, and\\nentertained no fear. And so they parted; she, perhaps, for half an hour\\nor so, the most deeply moved of the two. Miss Matty, however, was just\\nas captivating as usual in the next house they went to, where there were\\none or two people worth looking at, and the company in general was more\\ninteresting than at Ardmartin; but Colin, for his part, spent most of\\nthe evening on the hillside, revolving in the silence a hundred\\ntumultuous thoughts. It was the end of September, and the nights were\\ncold on the Holy Loch. There was not even a moon to enliven the\\nlandscape, and all that could be seen was the cold, blue glimmer of the\\nwater, upon which Colin looked down with a kind of desolate sense of\\nelevation--elevation of the mind and of the heart, which made the grief\\nof parting look like a grand moral agent, quickening all his powers, and\\nconcentrating his strength. Henceforward the strongest of personal\\nmotives was to inspire him in all his conflicts. He was going into the\\nbattle of life with his ladyâ\\x80\\x99s colours on his helmet, like a knight of\\nromance, and failure was not to be thought of as a possibility. As he\\nset his face to the wind, going back to Ardmartin, the pale sky\\nlightened over the other side of the loch, and underneath the breaking\\nclouds, which lay so black on the hills, Colin saw the distant glimmer\\nof a light, which looked like the light in the parlour window at Ramore.\\nJust then a sudden gust swept across the hill-side, throwing over him a\\nshower of falling leaves, and big rain-drops from the last shower. There\\nwas not a soul on the road but Colin himself, nor anything to be seen\\nfar or near, except the dark tree-tops in the Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s Glen, which were\\nsighing in the night wind, and the dark side of Ardmartin, where all the\\nshutters are closed, and one soft star hanging among the clouds just\\nover the spot where that little friendly light in the farmhouse of\\nRamore held up its glimmer of human consolation in the darkness. It was\\nnot Heroâ\\x80\\x99s torch to light her love--was it, perhaps, a sober gleam of\\ntruth and wisdom to call the young Leander back from those bitter waters\\nin which he could but perish? All kinds of fancies were in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind\\nas he went back, facing the wind, to the dull, closed up house, from\\nwhich the enchantment had departed; but among them there occurred no\\nthought of discouragement from this pursuit upon which now his heart was\\nset. He would have drowned himself cauld he have imagined it possible\\nthat he could cease to love--and so long as he loved how was it possible\\nto fail?\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd _must_ you be a Scotch minister?â\\x80\\x9d When Colin went home a fortnight\\nlater to make his preparations for returning to the University, he was\\noccupied, to the exclusion of almost all other questions, by revolving\\nthis. It is true that at his age, and with his inexperience, it was\\npossible to imagine that even a Scotch minister, totally unfavoured by\\nfortune, might, by mere dint of genius, raise himself to heights of fame\\nsufficient to bring Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s niece within his reach--but\\nthe thing was unlikely, even to the lively imagination of twenty. And it\\nwas the fact that Colin had no special â\\x80\\x9cvocationâ\\x80\\x9d towards the profession\\nfor which he was being trained. He had been educated and destined for it\\nall his life, and his thoughts had a natural bias that way. But\\notherwise there was no personal impulse in his mind towards what Mrs.\\nJordan called â\\x80\\x9cthe work of the ministry.â\\x80\\x9d Hitherto his personal impulses\\nhad been neither for nor against. Luckily for Colin, and many of his\\ncontemporaries, there were so many things to object to in the Church of\\nScotland, so many defects of order and external matters which required\\nreformation, that they were less strongly tempted to become sceptical in\\nmatters of faith than their fellows elsewhere. As for Colin himself, he\\nhad fallen off no doubt from the certainty of his boyhood upon many\\nimportant matters; but the lad, though he was a Scotchman, was happily\\nillogical, and suffered very little by his doubts. Nothing could have\\nmade him sceptical, in any real sense of the word, and accordingly there\\nwas no repulsion in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind against his future profession. But now!\\nHe turned it over in his mind night and day in the interval between\\nMattyâ\\x80\\x99s departure and his own return to Ramore. What if, instead of a\\nScotch minister, incapable of promotion, and to whom ambition itself was\\nunlawful, he were to address himself to the Bar, where there were at\\nleast chances and possibilities of fame? He was occupied with this\\nquestion, to the exclusion of every other, as he crossed the loch in the\\nlittle steamer, and landed on the pier near Ramore, where his young\\nbrothers met him, eager to carry his travelling-bag, and convey him home\\nin triumph. Colin was aware that such a proposal on his part would\\noccasion grievous disappointment at home, and he did not know how to\\nintroduce the subject, or disclose his wavering wishes. It was a\\nwonderful relief, as well as confusion to him, when he entered the\\nRamore parlour, to find Lauderdale in possession of the second\\narm-chair, opposite the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s, which was sacred to visitors. He had\\narrived only the evening before, having left Glasgow â\\x80\\x9cfor a holiday,\\nlike everybody else, in the saut-water season; the first I ever mind of\\nhaving in my life,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a certain boyish satisfaction,\\nstretching out his long limbs by the parlour fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s ower cauld to have much good of the water,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe boatâ\\x80\\x99s no laid up yet, waiting for Colin, but the weatherâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nwinterly--no to say soft,â\\x80\\x9d she added, with a little sigh, â\\x80\\x9cfor its aye\\nsoft weather among the lochs, though weâ\\x80\\x99ve had less rain than common\\nthis year.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd as the mistress spoke, the familiar, well-known rain came sweeping\\ndown over the hills. It had the usual effect upon the mind of the\\nsensitive woman. â\\x80\\x9cWe maun take aâ\\x80\\x99 the good we can of you, laddie,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid, laying her kind hand on her boyâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s only a sight we\\nget now in passing. Heâ\\x80\\x99s owre much thought of, and made of, to spend his\\ntime at hame,â\\x80\\x9d the mistress added, turning, with a half-reproachful\\npride to Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 sorry if the rain lasts, on your\\naccount. But, for myself, I could put up with a little soft weather, to\\nsee mair of Colin; no that I want him to stay at hame when he might be\\nenjoying himself,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, with a compunction. Soft weather on\\nthe Holy Loch signified rain and mist, and everything that was most\\ndiscouraging to Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s soul, but she was ready to undergo\\nanything the skies could inflict upon her, if fortified by the society\\nof her son.\\n\\nIt was the second night after his return before Colin could make up his\\nmind to introduce the subject of which his thoughts were full. Tea was\\nover by that time, and all the household assembled in the parlour. The\\nfarmer himself had just laid down his newspaper, from which he had been\\nreading scraps of county gossip aloud, somewhat to the indignation of\\nthe mistress, who, for her part, liked to hear what was going on in the\\nworld, and took a great interest in Parliament and the foreign\\nintelligence. â\\x80\\x9cI canna say that Iâ\\x80\\x99m heeding about the muckle apple\\nthatâ\\x80\\x99s been grown in Clydesdale, nor the new bailies in Greenock,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife. â\\x80\\x9cIf you would read us something wise-like about thae\\npoor oppressed Italians, or what Louiss Napoleon is thinking about--I\\ncanna excuse him for what they caâ\\x80\\x99 the _coo-detaw_,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut for aâ\\x80\\x99 that, I take a great interest in him;â\\x80\\x9d and with this the\\nmistress took up her knitting with a pleasant anticipation of more\\nimportant news to come.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s naething in the _Herald_ about Louiss Napoleon,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nfarmer, â\\x80\\x9cnor the Italians neither--no that I put much faith in thae\\nItalians; theyâ\\x80\\x99ll quarrel amang themselves when thereâ\\x80\\x99s naebody else to\\nquarrel wiâ\\x80\\x99--though Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying onything against Cavour and Garibaldi.\\nThe paperâ\\x80\\x99s filled full oâ\\x80\\x99 something mair immediately interesting--at\\nleast, it ought to have mair interest to you wiâ\\x80\\x99 a son thatâ\\x80\\x99s to be a\\nminister. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s three columns mair about that Dreepdaily case. It may\\nbe a grand thing for popular rights, but itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 ordeal for a man\\nto gang through,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, looking ruefully at his son.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was looking at that,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s his prayers the folk\\nseem to object to most--and no wonder. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard the man myselâ\\x80\\x99, and\\nhis sermon was not bad reasoning, if anybody wanted reasoning; but itâ\\x80\\x99s\\na wonderful thing to me the way that new preachers take upon them to\\nexplain matters to the Almighty,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend reflectively. â\\x80\\x9cSo\\nfar as I can see, weâ\\x80\\x99ve little to ask in our worship; but we have an\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 quantity of things to explain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is an ordeal I could never submit to,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with perhaps a\\nlittle more heat than was necessary. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99d rather starve than be set up\\nas a target for a parish. It is quite enough to make a cultivated clergy\\nimpossible for Scotland. Who would submit to expose oneâ\\x80\\x99s life, all\\noneâ\\x80\\x99s antecedents, all oneâ\\x80\\x99s qualities of mind and language to the\\nstupid criticism of a set of boors? It is a thing I never could submit\\nto,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, meaning to introduce his doubts upon the general\\nsubject by this violent means.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna approve of such large talking,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, laying down\\nhis newspaper. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a great protection to popular rights. I would\\nsooner run the risk of disgusting a fastidious lad now and then, than\\nput in a minister that gives nae satisfaction; and if you canna submit\\nto it, Colin, youâ\\x80\\x99ll never get a kirk, which would be worse than\\ncriticism,â\\x80\\x9d said his father, looking full into his face. The look\\nbrought a conscious colour to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, feeling himself driven into a corner, and\\ntaking what courage he could from the emergency, â\\x80\\x9cone might choose\\nanother profession;â\\x80\\x9d and then there was a pause, and everybody in the\\nroom looked with alarm and amazement on the bold speaker. â\\x80\\x9cAfter all,\\nthe Church is not the only thing in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, feeling the\\ngreatness of his temerity. â\\x80\\x9cNobody ventures to say it is in a\\nsatisfactory state. How often do I hear you criticising the sermon and\\nfinding fault with the prayers? and, as for Lauderdale, he finds fault\\nwith everything. Then, look how much a man has to bear before he gets a\\nchurch as you say. As soon as he has his presentation the Presbytery\\ncomes together and asks if there are any objections; and then the parish\\nsits upon the unhappy man; and, when everybody has had a turn at him,\\nand all his peculiarities and personal defects and family history have\\nbeen discussed before the Presbytery--and put in the newspapers, if they\\nhappen to be amusing--then the poor wretch has to sign a confession\\nwhich nobody--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop you there, Colin, my man,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s enough at one\\ntime. I wouldna say that you were aâ\\x80\\x99thegither wrong as touching the\\nsermon and the prayers. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 to go in from the like of this\\nhill-side and weary the very heart out of you in a close kirk, listening\\nto a man preaching that has nothing in this world to say. I am whiles\\ninclined to think--â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, thoughtfully--â\\x80\\x9claddies, you may as\\nwell go to your beds. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll see Colin the morn, and ye canna understand\\nwhat weâ\\x80\\x99re talking about. I am whiles disposed to think,â\\x80\\x9d he continued\\nafter a pause, during which the younger members of the family had left\\nthe room, after a little gentle persuasion on the part of the mistress,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhen I go into the kirk on a bonnie day, such as we have by times on\\nthe lock baith in summer and winter, that itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 waste of time.\\nYou lose aâ\\x80\\x99 the bonnie prospect, and you get naething but weariness for\\nyour pains. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve aye been awfuâ\\x80\\x99 against set prayers read out of a book;\\nbut I canna but allow the English chapel has a kind of advantage in\\nthat, for nae fool can spoil your devotion there, as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard it done\\nmany and manyâ\\x80\\x99s the time. I ken our ministerâ\\x80\\x99s prayers very near as well\\nas if they were written down,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer of Ramore, â\\x80\\x9cand the maist\\npart of them is great nonsense. Ony little scraps oâ\\x80\\x99 real supplication\\nthere may be in them, you could get through in five minutes; the rest is\\naâ\\x80\\x99 remarks, that I never can discriminate if theyâ\\x80\\x99re meant for me or for\\nthe Almighty; but my next neibor would think me an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 heathen if he\\nheard what Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, with a smile; â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99m far from\\nsure that I would get a mair merciful judgment from the wife herself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe mistress had been very busy with her knitting while her husband was\\nspeaking; but, notwithstanding her devotion to her work, she was uneasy\\nand could not help showing it. â\\x80\\x9cIf we had been our lane it would have\\nbeen naething,â\\x80\\x9d she said to Colin, privately; â\\x80\\x9cbut afore yon man thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\na stranger and doesna ken!â\\x80\\x9d With which sentiment she sat listening, much\\ndisturbed in her mind. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no a thing to say before the bairns,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid, when she was thus appealed to, â\\x80\\x9cnor before folk that dinna ken\\nyou. A stranger might think you were a careless man to hear you speak,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Mrs. Campbell, turning to Lauderdale with bitter vexation, â\\x80\\x9cfor aâ\\x80\\x99\\nthat you havena missed the kirk half a dozen times aâ\\x80\\x99 the years I have\\nkent you--and thatâ\\x80\\x99s a long time,â\\x80\\x9d said the mother, lifting hers soft\\neyes to her boy. When she looked at him she remembered that he too had\\nbeen rash in his talk. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re turning awfuâ\\x80\\x99 like your father, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the mistress, â\\x80\\x9ctaking up the same thoughtless way of talking. But I\\nthink different for aâ\\x80\\x99 you say. Our ain kirk is aye our ain kirk to you\\nas well as to me, in spite oâ\\x80\\x99 your speaking. Iâ\\x80\\x99m well accustomed to\\ntheir ways,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with a smile, to Lauderdale, who, so far from\\nbeing the dangerous observer she thought him, had gone off at a tangent\\ninto his own thoughts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Confession of Faith is a real respectable historical document,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cI might not like to commit myself to aâ\\x80\\x99 it says, if\\nyou were to ask me; but then Iâ\\x80\\x99m not the kind oâ\\x80\\x99 man that has a heart to\\ncommit myself to anything in the way of intellectual truth. I wouldna\\nbind myself to say that I would stand by any document a year after it\\nwas put forth, far less a hundred years. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s things in it naebody\\nbelieves--for example, about the earth being made in six days; but I\\nwould not advise a man to quarrel with his kirk and his profession for\\nthe like of that. I put no dependence on geology for my part, nor any of\\nthe sciences. How can I tell but somebody might make a discovery the\\nmorn that would upset all their fine stories? But, on the whole, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nvery little to say against the Confession. Itâ\\x80\\x99s far more guarded about\\npredestination and so forth than might have been expected. Every man of\\ncommon sense believes in predestination; though I would not be the man\\nto commit myself to any statement on the subject. The like of me is good\\nfor little,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend, stretching his long limbs towards the\\nfire, â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve great ambition for that callant. Heâ\\x80\\x99s not a common\\ncallant, though Iâ\\x80\\x99m speaking before his face,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cit\\nwould be terrible mortifying to me to see him put himself in a corner\\nand refuse the yoke.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I cannot bear the yoke conscientiously, I cannot bear it at all,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin, with a little heat. â\\x80\\x9cIf _you_ canâ\\x80\\x99t put your name to what\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t believe, why should I?--and as for ambition,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cambition! what does it mean?--a country church, and two or three\\nhundred ploughmen to criticise me, and the old wives to keep in good\\nhumour, and the young ones to drink tea with--is that work for a man?â\\x80\\x9d\\ncried the youth, whose mind was agitated, and who naturally had said a\\ngood deal more than he intended to say. He looked round in a little\\nalarm after this rash utterance, not knowing whether he had been right\\nor wrong in such a disclosure of his sentiments. The father and mother\\nlooked at each other, and then turned their eyes simultaneously upon\\ntheir son. Perhaps the mistress had a glimmering of the correct meaning\\nwhich Colin would not have betrayed wittingly had it cost him his life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, sometime yeâ\\x80\\x99ll think better,â\\x80\\x9d she cried under her\\nbreath--â\\x80\\x9cafter aâ\\x80\\x99 our pride in you and our hopes!â\\x80\\x9d The tears came into\\nher eyes as she looked at him. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s mair honour to serve God than to\\nget on in this world,â\\x80\\x9d said the mistress. The disappointment went to her\\nheart, as Colin could see; she put her hands hastily to her eyes to\\nclear away the moisture which dimmed them. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s maybe naething but a\\npassing fancy--but itâ\\x80\\x99s no what I expected to hear from any bairn of\\nmine,â\\x80\\x9d she said with momentary bitterness. As for the farmer, he looked\\non with a surprised and inquiring countenance.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere has some change come over you, Colin--what has happened?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nhis father. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no a man that despises money, nor thinks it a sin to\\nget on in the world, but itâ\\x80\\x99s only fools that quarrel wiâ\\x80\\x99 whatâ\\x80\\x99s within\\ntheir reach for envy of what they can never win to. If ye had displayed\\na strong bent any other way I wouldna have minded,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin. â\\x80\\x9cBut\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s the new-fangled dishes at Ardmartin that have spoiled the callantâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndigestion; heâ\\x80\\x99ll come back to his natural inclination when heâ\\x80\\x99s been at\\nhome for a day or two,â\\x80\\x9d the farmer added, laying his large hand on his\\nsonâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder with a pressure which meant more than his words; but the\\nyouth was vexed, and impatient, and imagined himself laughed at, which\\nis the most dreadful of insults at Colinâ\\x80\\x99s age, and in his\\ncircumstances. He paid no attention to his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s looks, but plunged\\nstraightway into vehement declaration of his sentiments, to which the\\nelder people around him listened with many complications of feeling\\nunknown to Colin. The lad thought, as was natural at his years, that\\nnobody had ever felt before him the same bondage of circumstance and\\nperplexities of soul, and that it was a new revelation he was making to\\nhis little audience. If he could have imagined that both the men were\\nlooking at him with the half sympathy, half pity, half envy of their\\nmaturer years, remembering as vividly as if it had occurred but\\nyesterday similar outbreaks of impatience and ambition and natural\\nresistance to all the obstacles of life, Colin would have felt deeply\\nhumiliated in his youthful fervour; or, if he could but have penetrated\\nthe film of softening dew in his motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and beheld there the\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s perennial spectatorship of that conflict which goes on for ever.\\nInstead of that, he thought he was making a new revelation to his\\nhearers; he thought he was cruel to them, tearing asunder their pleasant\\nmists of illusion, and disenchanting their eyes; he had not an idea that\\nthey knew all about it better than he did, and were watching him as he\\nrushed along the familiar path which they all had trod in different\\nways, and of which they knew the inevitable ending. Colin, in the heat\\nand impatience of his youth, took full advantage of his moment of\\nutterance. He poured forth in his turn that flood of immeasurable\\ndiscontent with all conditions and restrictions, which is the privilege\\nof his years. To be sure, the restrictions and conditions surrounding\\nhimself were, so far as he knew, the sole objects of that indignation\\nand scorn and defiance which came to his lips by force of nature. As for\\nhis mother, she listened, for her part, with that mortification which is\\nalways the womanâ\\x80\\x99s share. She understood him, sympathised with him, and\\nyet did not understand nor could tolerate his dissent from all that in\\nher better judgment she had decided upon on his behalf. She was far more\\ntender, but she was lest tolerant than the other spectators of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\noutburst; and mingled with all her personal feeling was a sense of\\nwounded pride and mortification, that her boy had thus betrayed himself\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbefore a stranger.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cIf we had been our lane, it would have been less\\nmatter,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, as she wiped the furtive tears hurriedly\\nfrom the corners of her eyes.\\n\\nWhen Colin had come to an end there was a pause. The boy himself thought\\nit was a pause of horror and consternation, and perhaps was rather\\npleased to produce an effect in some degree corresponding to his own\\nexcitement. After that moment of silence, however, the farmer got up\\nfrom his chair. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s very near time we were aâ\\x80\\x99 gaun to our beds,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nbig Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll take a look round to see that the beasts are\\ncomfortable, and then weâ\\x80\\x99ll have in the hot water. You and me can have a\\ntalk the morn,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer to his son. This was all the reply which\\nthe youth received from the parental authorities. When the master went\\nout to look after the beasts, Lauderdale followed to the door, where\\nColin in another moment strayed after him, considerably mortified, to\\ntell the truth; for even his mother addressed herself to the question of\\nâ\\x80\\x9chot water,â\\x80\\x9d which implied various other accessories of the homely\\nsupper-table; and the young man, in his excitement and elevation of\\nfeeling, felt as if he had suddenly tumbled down out of the stormy but\\nlofty firmament, into which he was soaring--down, with a shock, into the\\nembraces of the homely tenacious earth. He went after his friend, and\\nstood by Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s side, looking out into a darkness so profound that\\nit made his eyes ache and confused his very mind. The only gleam of\\nlight visible in earth or heaven was big Colinâ\\x80\\x99s lantern, which showed a\\ntiny gleam from the door of the byre where the farmer was standing. All\\nthe lovely landscape round, the loch and the hills, the sky and the\\nclouds, lay unseen--hidden in the night. â\\x80\\x9cWhich is an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 grand moral\\nlesson, if we had but sense to discern it,â\\x80\\x9d said the voice of Lauderdale\\nascending half-way up to the clouds; â\\x80\\x9cfor the loch hasnaâ\\x80\\x99 vanished, as\\nmight be supposed, but only the light. As for you, callant, you ken\\nneither the light nor the darkness as yet, but are aye seeing miraculous\\neffects like yon man Turnerâ\\x80\\x99s pictures, Northern Streamers, or Aurora\\nBorealis, or whatever ye may call it. And itâ\\x80\\x99s but just you should have\\nyour day;â\\x80\\x9d with which words Lauderdale heaved a great sigh, which moved\\nthe clouds of hair upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s forehead, and even seemed to disturb,\\nfor a moment, the profound gloom of the night.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by having my day?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was affronted by\\nthe suggestion. â\\x80\\x9cYou know I have said nothing that is not true. Can I\\nhelp it if I see the difficulties of my own position more clearly than\\nyou do, who are not in my circumstances?â\\x80\\x9d cried the lad with a little\\nindignation. Lauderdale, who was watching the lantern gliding out and in\\nthrough the darkness, was some time before he made any reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no surprised at yon callant Leander, when one comes to think of\\nit,â\\x80\\x9d he said in his reflective way; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a fine symbol, that Hero in\\nher tower. May be she took the lamp from the domestic altar and left the\\nhousehold god in darkness,â\\x80\\x9d said the calm philosopher; â\\x80\\x9cbut that makes\\nno difference to the story. I wouldnaâ\\x80\\x99 say but I would swim the\\nHellespont myself for such an inducement--or the Holy Loch--itâ\\x80\\x99s little\\nmatter which; but whiles she lets fall the torch before you get to the\\nend--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean? or what has Hero to do with me?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, with a\\nsecret flush of shame and rage, which the darkness concealed but which\\nhe could scarcely restrain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was not speaking of you--and after all, itâ\\x80\\x99s but a fable,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cmost history is fable, you know; itâ\\x80\\x99s no actual events,\\n(which I never believe in, for my part,) but the instincts oâ\\x80\\x99 the human\\nmind that make history--and thatâ\\x80\\x99s how the Heros and Leanders are aye to\\nbe accounted for. He was drowned in the end like most people,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, turning back to the parlour where the mistress was seated,\\npondering with a troubled countenance upon this new aspect of her boyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlife. Amid the darkness of the world outside this tender woman sat in\\nthe sober radiance of her domestic hearth, surrounded and enshrined by\\nlight; but she was not like Hero on the tower. Colin, too, came back,\\nfollowing his friend with a flush of excitement upon his youthful\\ncountenance. After all, the idea was not displeasing to the young man.\\nThe Hellespont, or the Holy Loch, were nothing to the bitter waters\\nwhich he was prepared to breast by the light of the imaginary torch held\\nup in the hand of that imaginary woman who was beckoning Colin, as he\\nthought, into the unknown world. Life was beginning anew in his person,\\nand all the fables had to be enacted over again; and what did it matter\\nto the boyâ\\x80\\x99s heroic fancy, if he too should go to swell the record of\\nthe ancient martyrs, and be drowned, as Lauderdale said--like most\\npeople--in the end?\\n\\nThere was no further conversation upon this important subject until next\\nmorning, when the household of Ramore got up early, and sat down to\\nbreakfast before it was perfect daylight; but Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart jumped to\\nhis mouth, and a visible thrill went through the whole family, when the\\nfarmer came in from his early inspection of all the byres and stables,\\nwith another letter from Sir Thomas Frankland conspicuous in his hand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe question is, will ye go or will ye stay?â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin of Ramore;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut for this, you and me might have had a mair serious question to\\ndiscuss. I see a providence in it for my part. Youâ\\x80\\x99re but a callant; it\\nwill do you nae harm to wait; and youâ\\x80\\x99ll be in the way of seeing the\\nworld at--what do they call the place? If your mother has nae\\nobjections, and ye see your ain way to accepting, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be very well\\ncontent. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 kind oâ\\x80\\x99 Sir Thomas after the way yeâ\\x80\\x99ve rejected aâ\\x80\\x99\\nhis advances--but, no doubt heâ\\x80\\x99s heard that you got on gey weel, on the\\nwhole, at your ain college,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, with a little complacency.\\nThey were sitting late over the breakfast table, the younger boys\\nlooking on with eager eyes, wondering over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s wonderful chances,\\nand feeling severely the contrast of their own lot, who had to take up\\nthe ready satchel and the â\\x80\\x9cpiece,â\\x80\\x9d which was to occupy their healthful\\nappetites till the evening, and hurry off three miles down the loch to\\nschool. As for Archie, he had been long gone to his hard labour on the\\nfarm, and the mother and father and the visitor were now sitting, a\\nlittle committee upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s prospects, which the lad himself\\ncontemplated with a mixture of delight and defiance wonderful to see.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s time for the school, bairns,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife; â\\x80\\x9cbe good\\nladdies, and dinna linger on the road either coming or going. Yeâ\\x80\\x99ll get\\napples a-piece in the press. I couldna give ony advice, if you ask me,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the Mistress, looking at her son with her tender eyes: â\\x80\\x9cColin, my\\nman, itâ\\x80\\x99s no for me nor your father either to say one thing or\\nanother--itâ\\x80\\x99s you that must decide--itâ\\x80\\x99s your ain well-being and comfort\\nand happiness----.â\\x80\\x9d Here the Mistress stopped short with an emotion\\nwhich nobody could explain; and at which even Colin, who had the only\\nclue to it, looked up out of his own thoughts, with a momentary\\nsurprise.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHoot,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re aye thinking of happiness, you women. I\\nhope the laddieâ\\x80\\x99s happiness doesna lie in the power of a yearâ\\x80\\x99s change\\none way or another. I canna see that it will do him any harm--especially\\nafter what he was saying last night--to pause awhile and take a little\\nthought; and hereâ\\x80\\x99s the best opportunity he could well have. But he\\ndoesna say anything himself--and if youâ\\x80\\x99re against it, Colin, speak out.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s your concern, most of all, as your mother says.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe callantâ\\x80\\x99s in a terrible swither,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a smile;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99ll have it, and heâ\\x80\\x99ll no have it. For one thing, itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ndisappointment to get your ain way just after youâ\\x80\\x99ve made up your mind\\nthat youâ\\x80\\x99re an injured man; and heâ\\x80\\x99s but a callant after all, and kens\\nno better. For my part, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no fond of changing when youâ\\x80\\x99ve once laid\\nyour plans. No man can tell what terrible difference a turn in the road\\nmay make. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aye best to go straight on. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s exceptions,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Lauderdale, laying his hand on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. â\\x80\\x9cSo far as I\\ncan see, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason in this world why the callant should not\\nstand still a moment and taste the sweetness of his lot. Heâ\\x80\\x99s come to\\nmanâ\\x80\\x99s estate, and the heavens have never gloomed on him yet. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nevil in him, that I can see,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend, with an unusual\\ntrembling in his voice; â\\x80\\x9cbut for human weakness, it might have been the\\nlad Michael or Gabriel, out of heaven, thatâ\\x80\\x99s been my companion these\\ngladsome years. It may be but more sweetness and blessing thatâ\\x80\\x99s in\\nstore for him. I know no reason why he shouldna pause while the sunâ\\x80\\x99s\\nshining, and see Godâ\\x80\\x99s meaning. It cannot be but good.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe ladâ\\x80\\x99s friend who understood him best stopped short, like his mother,\\nwith something in his throat that marred his utterance. Why was it?\\nColin looked up with the sunshine in his eyes, and laughed with a little\\nannoyance, a little impatience. He was no more afraid of his lot, nor of\\nwhat the next turn in the path would bring, than a child is who knows no\\nevil. Life was not solemn, but glorious, a thing to be conquered and\\nmade beautiful, to his eyes. He did not understand what they meant by\\ntheir faltering and their fears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI feel, on the whole, disposed to accept Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s offer,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung prince. â\\x80\\x9cIt is no favour, for I am quite able to be his boyâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntutor, as he says; and I see nothing particularly serious in it either;\\nmost Scotch students stop short sometime and have a spell of teaching. I\\nhave been tutor at Ardmartin; I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind being tutor at Wodensbourne.\\nI would not be dependent on Sir Thomas Frankland or any man,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin; â\\x80\\x9cbut I am glad to work for myself, and free you, father. I know\\nyou are willing to keep me at college, but you have plenty to do for\\nArchie and the rest; and now it is my turn; I may help myself and them\\ntoo,â\\x80\\x9d cried the youth, glad to disguise in that view of the matter the\\nthrill of delight at his new prospects, which came from a very different\\nsource. â\\x80\\x9cIt will give us a little time, as you say, to think it all\\nover,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, after a momentary pause, and turned upon his mother\\nwith a smile. â\\x80\\x9cIs there anything to look melancholy about?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\ntossing back from his forehead the clouds of his brown hair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, no, God forbid!â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress--â\\x80\\x9cnothing but hope and the\\nblessing of God;â\\x80\\x9d but she turned aside from the table, and began to put\\naway the things by way of concealing the tears that welled up to her\\ntender eyes; though neither she nor any one for her could have told why.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind your mother,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, â\\x80\\x9cthough itâ\\x80\\x99s out of the\\ncommon to see a cloud on her face when thereâ\\x80\\x99s no cloud to speak of on\\nthe sky. But women are aye having freits and fancies. I think myselâ\\x80\\x99\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s the wisest thing ye can do to close with Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s proposal. I\\nwouldna say but youâ\\x80\\x99ll see a good deal oâ\\x80\\x99 the world,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer,\\nshrewd but ignorant; â\\x80\\x9cnot that Iâ\\x80\\x99m so simple as to suppose that an\\nEnglish gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s country-seat will bring you to onything very\\nextraordinary in the way of company; but still, that class of folk is\\nwonderfully connected, and ye might see mair there in a season than you\\ncould here in a lifetime. Itâ\\x80\\x99s time I were looking after Archie and the\\nmen,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s no often Iâ\\x80\\x99m so late in the morning. I\\nsuppose youâ\\x80\\x99ll write to Sir Thomas yourself, and make aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\narrangements. Ye can say weâ\\x80\\x99re quite content, and pleased at his\\nthoughtfulness. If thatâ\\x80\\x99s no to your mind, Colin, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry for it; for\\na man should be aye man enough to give thanks where thanks are due.â\\x80\\x9d\\nWith this last admonition big Colin of Ramore took up his hat and went\\noff to his fields. â\\x80\\x9cI wish the callant didna keep a grudge,â\\x80\\x9d he said to\\nhimself, as he went upon his cheerful way. â\\x80\\x9cIf he were to set up in\\nrivalry wiâ\\x80\\x99 young Frankland!â\\x80\\x9d but with the thought a certain smile came\\nupon the fatherâ\\x80\\x99s face. He too could not refrain from a certain contempt\\nof the baronetâ\\x80\\x99s dainty son; and there was scarcely any limit to his\\npride and confidence in his boy.\\n\\nThe Mistress occupied herself in putting things to rights in the parlour\\nlong after her husband had gone to the fields. She thought Lauderdale\\ntoo wanted to be alone with Colin; and, with natural jealousy, could not\\npermit the first word of counsel to come from any lips but her own. The\\nmistress had no baby to occupy her in these days; the little one whom\\nshe had on her bosom at the opening of our history, who bore her own\\nname and her own smile, and was the one maiden blossom of her life, had\\ngone back to God who gave her; and, when her boys were at school, the\\ngentle woman was alone. There was little doing in the dairy just then,\\nand Mrs. Campbell had planned her occupations so as to have all the time\\nthat was possible to enjoy her sonâ\\x80\\x99s society. So she had no special call\\nupon her at that moment, and lingered over her little business, till\\nLauderdale, who would fain have said his say, strayed out in despair,\\nfinding no room for him. â\\x80\\x9cWhen youâ\\x80\\x99ve finished your letter, Colin,\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll find me on the hill,â\\x80\\x9d he said, as he went out; and could not\\nrefrain from a murmur in his own mind at the troublesome cares of â\\x80\\x9cthae\\nwomen.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re sweet to see about a house, and the place is hame where\\nthey are,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher to himself with a sigh; â\\x80\\x9cbut, oh, such\\nfykes as they ware their hearts on!â\\x80\\x9d The mistressâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cfykes,â\\x80\\x9d however,\\nwere over when the stranger left the house. She came softly to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntable, where he was writing, and sat down beside him. As for Colin, he\\nwas so much absorbed in his letter that he did not observe his mother;\\nand it was only when he lifted his head to consider a sentence, and\\nfound her before him, that he woke up, with a little start, out of that\\nmore agreeable occupation, and asked, â\\x80\\x9cDo you want me?â\\x80\\x9d with a look of\\nannoyance which went to the mistressâ\\x80\\x99s heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, Colin, I want you just for a moment,â\\x80\\x9d said his mother. â\\x80\\x9cI want to\\nspeak to you of this new change in your life. Your father thinks nothing\\nbut itâ\\x80\\x99s Sir Thomas Frankland youâ\\x80\\x99re going to, to be tutor to his boys;\\nbut, oh, Colin, I ken better! Itâ\\x80\\x99s no the fine house and the new life\\nthat lights such light in my laddieâ\\x80\\x99s eye. Colin, listen to me. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfar above you in this world, though itâ\\x80\\x99s no to be looked for that I\\ncould think ony woman was above you; but sheâ\\x80\\x99s a lady with mony wooers,\\nand youâ\\x80\\x99re but a poor manâ\\x80\\x99s son. Oh, Colin, my man! dinna gang near that\\nplace, nor put yourself in the way of evil, if you havena confidence\\nboth in her and yourselâ\\x80\\x99. Do you think you can see her day by day and no\\nbreak your heart? or do you think sheâ\\x80\\x99s worthy of a heart to be thrown\\naway under her feet? Or, oh, my laddie! tell me this first of aâ\\x80\\x99--do you\\nthink you could ask her, or she could consent, to lose fortune and\\ngrandeur for your sake? Colin, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no joking; itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 earnest,\\nwhatever you may think. Tell me--if youâ\\x80\\x99ve ony regard for your mother,\\nor wish her ony kind of comfort the time youâ\\x80\\x99re away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis Mrs. Campbell said with tears shining in her eyes, and a look of\\nentreaty in her face, which Colin had hard ado to meet. But the lad was\\nfull of his own thoughts, and impatient of the interruption which\\ndetained him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish I knew what you meant,â\\x80\\x9d he said pettishly. â\\x80\\x9cI wish you would not\\ntalk of--people who have nothing to do with my poor little concerns.\\nSurely, I may be suffered to engage in ordinary work like other people,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin. â\\x80\\x9cAs for the lady you speak of--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd here the youth paused with a natural smile lurking at the corners of\\nhis lips--a smile of youthful confidence and self-gratulation. Not for a\\nkingdom would the young hero have boasted of any look or word she had\\never bestowed upon him; but he could not deny himself the delicious\\nconsciousness that she must have had something to do with this\\nproposal--that it must have been her suggestion, or at least supported,\\nseconded by her. Only through her could her uncle have known that he was\\ntutor at Ardmartin; and the thought that it was she herself who was\\ntaking what maidenly means she could for their speedy reunion was too\\nsweet to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart to be breathed in words, even if he could have\\ndone it without a betrayal of his hopes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, Colin, the lady--â\\x80\\x9d said his mother; â\\x80\\x9cyou say no more in words, but\\nyour eye smiles, and your mouth, and I see the flush on your cheek.\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s bonnie and sweet and fair-spoken, and I canna think she means ony\\nharm; but, oh, Colin, my man, mind what a difference in this world!\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ve nothing to offer her like what sheâ\\x80\\x99s been used to,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ninnocent woman, â\\x80\\x9cand if I was to see my son come back breaking his heart\\nfor ane that was above his reach, and maybe no worthy!--â\\x80\\x9d She could not\\nsay any more, partly because she had exhausted herself, partly because\\nColin rose from the table with a flush of excitement, which made his\\nmother tremble.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWorthy of me!â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with a kind of groan, â\\x80\\x9cworthy of me!\\nMother, I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you know what you are saying. I am going to\\nWodensbourne whatever happens. It may be for good or for evil; I canâ\\x80\\x99t\\ntell; but I am going, and you must ask me no further questions--not on\\nthis point. I am to be tutor to Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s boy,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nsitting down, with the smile again in his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cNothing more--and what\\ncould happen better to a poor Scotch student? He might have had a\\nCambridge man, and he chooses me. Let me finish my letter, mother dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe wouldna get many Cambridge men, or ony other men, like my boy,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe mother half reassured; and she rearranged with her hands, that\\ntrembled a little, the writing-desk, which Colinâ\\x80\\x99s hasty movements had\\nthrust out of the way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, mother, but a Scotch University does not count for the same as an\\nEnglish one,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a smile and a sigh; â\\x80\\x9cit is not for my\\ngifts Sir Thomas has chosen me,â\\x80\\x9d he added, somewhat impatiently, taking\\nup his pen again. What was it for? That old obligation of Harry\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s life saved, which Colin had always treated as a fiction? or\\nthe sweet influence of some one who knew that Colin loved her? Which was\\nit? If the youth determined it should be the last, could anybody wonder?\\nHe bent his head again over his paper, and wrote, with his heart beating\\nhigh, that acceptance which was to restore him to her society. As for\\nthe Mistress, she left her son, and went about her homely business,\\nwiping some tears from her eyes. â\\x80\\x9cI kenna what woman could close her\\nheart,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, with a little sob, in her ignorance and\\ninnocence. â\\x80\\x9cOh, if sheâ\\x80\\x99s only worthy!â\\x80\\x9d but, for all that, the motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nheart was heavy within her, though she could not have told why.\\n\\nThe letter was finished and sealed up before Colin joined his friend on\\nthe hillside, where Lauderdale was straying about with his hands in his\\npockets, breathing long sighs into the fresh air, and unable to\\nrestrain, or account for, his own restlessness and uneasiness. One of\\nthose great dramas of sunshine and shadow, which are familiar to the\\nHoly Loch, was going on just then among the hills, and the philosopher\\nhad made various attempts to interest himself in those wonderful\\nalternations of gloom and light, but without avail. Nature, which is so\\nfull of interest when the heart is unoccupied, dwindles and grows pale\\nin presence of the poorest human creature who throws a shadow into her\\nsunshine. Not all those wonderful gleams of light--not all those clouds,\\ndriven wildly like so many gigantic phantoms into the solemn hollows,\\ncould touch the heart of the man who was trembling for his friend.\\nLauderdale roused himself up when Colin came to him, and met him\\ncheerfully. â\\x80\\x9cSo youâ\\x80\\x99ve written your letter?â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand accepted the\\noffer? I thought as much, by your eye.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou did not need to consult my eye,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, gaily. â\\x80\\x9cI said as\\nmuch. But I must walk down the loch a mile or two to meet the postman.\\nWill you come? Let us take the good of the hills,â\\x80\\x9d said the youth, with\\nhis heart running over. â\\x80\\x9cWho can tell when we may be here again\\ntogether? I like this autumn weather, with its stormy colours; and I\\nsuppose now my fortune, as you call it, will lead me to a flat\\ncountry--that is, for a year or two at least.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a kind of groan; â\\x80\\x9cthat is how the world\\nappears at your years. Who can tell when we may be here again together?\\nWho can tell, laddie, what thoughts may be in our hearts when we _are_\\nhere again? I never have any security myself, when I leave a place, that\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll ever dare to come back,â\\x80\\x9d said the meditative man. â\\x80\\x9cThe innocent\\nfields might have a cruel aspect, as if God had cursed them, and, for\\nanything I know, I might hate the flowers that could bloom, and the sun\\nthat could shine, and had no heart for my trouble. No that you\\nunderstand what Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning; but thatâ\\x80\\x99s the way it affects a man like\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat are you thinking of?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, with a little dismay; â\\x80\\x9cone\\nwould fancy you saw some terrible evil approaching. Of course the future\\nis uncertain, but I am not particularly alarmed by anything that appears\\nto me. What are you thinking of, Lauderdale? Your own career?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, just my ain career,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a smile; â\\x80\\x9csuch a\\ncareer to make a work about! though I am just as content as most men. I\\nmind when my ain spirit was whiles uplifted as yours is, laddie; itâ\\x80\\x99s\\n_that_ that makes a man think. It comes natural to the time of life,\\nlike the bright eye and the bloom on the cheek; and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no sentence\\nof death in it either, if you come to that,â\\x80\\x9d he went on to himself after\\na pause. â\\x80\\x9cLife holds on--it aye holds on; a hope mair or less makes\\nlittle count. And without the struggle, never man that was worth\\ncalling man came to his full stature.â\\x80\\x9d All this Lauderdale kept saying\\nto himself as he descended the hillside, leaping here and there over a\\nhalf-concealed streamlet, and making his way through the withered ferns\\nand the long tangled streamers of the bramble, which caught at him as he\\npassed. He was not so skilful in overcoming these obstacles as Colin,\\nwho was to the manner born; and he got a little out of breath as he\\nfollowed the lad, who, catching his monologue by intervals in the\\ndescent, looked at the melancholy philosopher with his young eyes, which\\nlaughed, and did not understand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder what you are thinking of,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cNot of me, certainly;\\nbut I see you are afraid of something, as if I were going to encounter a\\ngreat danger. Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, stopping and laying his hand on\\nhis friendâ\\x80\\x99s arm for one confidential moment, â\\x80\\x9cwhatever danger there is,\\nI _have_ encountered it. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be afraid for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was saying nothing about you, callant,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, pettishly.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should I aye be thinking of you? A man has more things to consider\\nin this life than the vagaries of a slip of a laddie, that doesna see\\nwhere heâ\\x80\\x99s bound for. Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of things far out of your way,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe philosopher; â\\x80\\x9cof disappointments and heart-breaks, and aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\neclipses that are invisible to common eâ\\x80\\x99en. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen many in my day.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve seen a trifling change that made no difference to the world quench\\naâ\\x80\\x99 the light and aâ\\x80\\x99 the comfort out of life. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s more things in\\nheaven or earth than were ever dreamt of at your years. And whiles a man\\nwonders how, for very pity, God can stay still in His heavens and look\\non--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin could not say anything to the groan with which his friend broke\\noff. He was troubled and puzzled, and could not make it out. They went\\non together along the white line of road, on which, far off in the\\ndistance, the youth already saw the postman whom he was hastening to\\nmeet; and, busy as he was with his own thoughts, Colin had already\\nforgotten to inquire what his companion referred to, when his attention,\\nwhich had wandered completely away, was suddenly recalled again by the\\nvoice at his side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m speaking like a man that cannot see the end,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhich is clear to Him, if thereâ\\x80\\x99s any meaning in life. Youâ\\x80\\x99re for\\ntaking your chance and posting your letter, laddie! and you ken nothing\\nabout any nonsense that an old fool like me may be maundering. For one\\nthing, thereâ\\x80\\x99s aye plenty to divert the mind in this country,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, with a sigh; and stood still at the foot of the long slope\\nthey had just descended, looking with a wistful abstracted look upon the\\nloch and the hills; at which change of mood Colin could not restrain\\nhimself, but with ready boyish mirth laughed aloud.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat has this country to do with it all? You are in a very queer mood\\nto-day, Lauderdale--one moment as solemn and mysterious as if you knew\\nof some great calamity, and the next talking of the country. What do you\\nmean I wonder?â\\x80\\x9d But his wonder was not very deep, and stirred lightly in\\nthe heart which was full of so many wishes and ambitions of its own.\\nWith that letter in his hand, and that new life before him, how could he\\nhelp but look at the lonely man by his side with a half-divine\\ncompassion?--a man to whom life offered no prizes, and scarcely any\\nhopes. He was aware in his heart that Lauderdale was anxious about\\nhimself, and the thought of that unnecessary solicitude moved Colin half\\nto laughter. Poor Lauderdale--upon whom he looked down from the\\nelevation of his young life with the tenderest pity! He smiled upon his\\nfriend in his exaltation and superiority. â\\x80\\x9cYou are more inexplicable\\nthan usual to-day. I wonder what you mean?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin with all the\\nsunshine of youth and joy, defying evil forebodings, in his eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would take a wise man to tell,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cI would not\\npretend, for my own part, to fathom what any fool might mean--much less\\nwhat I mean myself, that have glimmerings of sense at times. Yon\\nsunshineâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 prying about the hills. Lightâ\\x80\\x99s aye inquisitive, and\\nwould fain be at the bottom of every mystery--which is, maybe, the\\nreason,â\\x80\\x9d said the speculative observer, â\\x80\\x9cwhy thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae grandeur to\\nspeak of, nor meaning, according to mortal notions, without clouds and\\ndarkness. Yonderâ\\x80\\x99s your postman, callant. Give him the letter and be\\ndone with it. I whiles find myself wondering how it is that we take so\\nlittle thought to Godâ\\x80\\x99s meanings--what ye might call His lighter\\nmeanings--His easy verses and such-like, that are thrown about the\\nworld, in the winds and the sky. To be sure, I ken just as well as you\\ndo that itâ\\x80\\x99s currents of air, and masses of vapour, and electricity, and\\nall the rest of it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy learning the words--but will you\\ntell me thereâ\\x80\\x99s no meaning to a manâ\\x80\\x99s heart and soul in the like of\\nthat?â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s companion, stopping suddenly with a sigh of\\nimpatience and vexation, which had to do with something more vital than\\nthe clouds. Just then, nature truly seemed to have come to a pause, and\\nto be standing still, like themselves, looking on. The sky that was so\\nblue and broad a moment since had contracted to a black vault over the\\nHoly Loch. Blackness that was positive and not a mere negation frowned\\nout of all the half-disclosed mysterious hollows of the hills. The\\nleaves that remained on the trees thrilled with a spasmodic shiver, and\\nthe little ripples came crowding up on the beach with a sighing\\nsuppressed moan of suspense and apprehension. So, at least, it seemed to\\none if not both of the spectators standing by.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt means a thunderstorm, in the first place,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9clook how it\\nbegins to come down in a torrent of gloom over Loch Goil. We have just\\ntime to get under shelter. It is very well for us we are so near\\nRamore.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy--â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. He repeated the syllable over again and again as\\nthey hurried back. â\\x80\\x9cBut the time will come, when weâ\\x80\\x99ll no be near\\nRamore,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself as the storm reached him and dashed in his\\nface not twenty yards from the open door. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s laugh, as he reached\\nwith a bound the kindly portal, was all the answer which youth and hope\\ngave to experience. The boy was not to be discouraged on that sweet\\nthreshold of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\n\\nWodensbourne was as different from any house that Colin had ever seen\\nbefore, as the low flat country, rich and damp and monotonous, was\\nunlike the infinitely varied landscape to which his eye had been\\naccustomed all his life. The florid upholstery of Ardmartin contrasted\\nalmost as strangely with the sober magnificence of the old family-house,\\nin which the Franklands had lived and died for generations, as did the\\nsimple little rooms to which Colin had been accustomed in his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhouse. Perhaps, on the whole, Ramore, where everything was for use and\\nnothing for show, was less unharmonious with all he saw about him than\\nthe equipments of the bran new castle, all built out of new money, and\\ngilded and lackered to a climax of domestic finery. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s pupil was\\nthe invalid of the family; a boy of twelve, who could not go to Eton\\nlike his brothers, but whom the good-natured baronet thought, as was\\nnatural, the cleverest of his family.--â\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s why I wanted you so\\nmuch, Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d Sir Thomas said, by way of setting Colin at ease in\\nhis new occupation; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s not a boy to be kept to classics isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nCharley--thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing that boy wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t master--and shut up as he has\\nto be, with his wretched health, he wants a little variety. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always\\nheard you took a wider range in Scotland; thatâ\\x80\\x99s what I want for my\\nboy.â\\x80\\x9d It was with this exposition of his patronâ\\x80\\x99s wishes that the new\\ntutor was introduced to his duties at Wodensbourne. But a terrible\\ndisappointment awaited the young man, a disappointment utterly\\nunforeseen. There was nobody there but Sir Thomas himself, and Charley,\\nand some little ones still in the nursery. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re all by ourselves, but\\nyou wonâ\\x80\\x99t mind,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet, who seemed to think it all the better\\nfor Colin; â\\x80\\x9cmy lady and Matty will be home before Christmas, and you can\\nget yourself settled comfortably in the meantime. Lady Frankland is with\\nher sister, who is in very bad health. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what people mean by\\ngetting into bad health--women, too, that canâ\\x80\\x99t go in for free living\\nand that sort of thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas. â\\x80\\x9cThe place looks dreary\\nwithout the ladies, but theyâ\\x80\\x99ll be back before Christmas,â\\x80\\x9d and he went\\nto sleep after dinner as usual, and left the young tutor at the other\\nside of the table sitting in a kind of stupefied amazement and\\nmortification, in the silence, wondering what he came here for, and\\nwhere all his hopes and brilliant auguries had gone.\\n\\nPerhaps Colin did not know what he himself meant when he accepted Sir\\nThomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s proposal. He thought he was coming to live in Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsociety, to be her companion, to walk with her and talk with her, as he\\nhad done at Ardmartin; but, when he arrived to find Wodensbourne\\ndeserted, with nothing to be seen but Sir Thomas and a nursery\\ngoverness, who sometimes emerged with her little pupils from the unknown\\nregions upstairs, and was very civil to the new tutor, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndisappointment was overwhelming. He despised himself with a bitterness\\nonly to be equalled by the brilliancy of those vain expectations over\\nwhich he laughed in youthful rage and scorn. It was not to be Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncompanion he had come; it was not to see, however far off, any portion\\nof the great world which he could not help imagining sometimes must be\\nvisible from such an elevation. It was only to train Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nprecocious intellect, and amuse the baronet a little at dinner. After\\ndinner Sir Thomas went to sleep, and even Charley was out of the way,\\nand the short winter days closed down early over the great house, over\\nthe damp woods and silent park, which kept repeating themselves, day by\\nday, upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s wearied brain. There was not even an undulation\\nwithin sight, nothing higher than the dull line of trees, which after a\\nwhile it made him sick to look at. To be sure, the sunshine now and then\\ncaught upon the lofty lantern of Earie Cathedral, and by that means woke\\nup a gleam of light on the flat country; but that, and the daily\\nconflict with Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s sharp invalid understanding, and the sight of\\nSir Thomas sleeping after dinner, conveyed no exhilaration to speak of\\nto lighten the dismal revulsion of poor Colinâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts. His heart rose\\nindignant sometimes, which did him more good. This was the gulf of\\ndismay he tumbled into without defence or preparation after the burst of\\nhope and foolish youthful delight with which he left Ramore.\\n\\nAs for the society at Wodensbourne, it was at the present moment of the\\nmost limited description. Colin, who was inexperienced, roused up out of\\nhis dullness a little when he heard that two of the canons of Earie were\\ncoming to dinner one evening. The innocent Scotch lad woke himself up,\\nwith a little curiosity about the clerical dignitaries, of whom he knew\\nnothing, and a good deal of anxiety to comport himself as became the\\nrepresentative of a Scotch University, about whom he did not doubt the\\nvisitors would be a little curious. It struck Colin with the oddest\\nsurprise and disappointment, to find that the canons of Earie were\\nperfectly indifferent about the Scotch student. The curate of the\\nparish, indeed, who was also dining at Wodensbourne that day, was\\nwonderfully civil to the new tutor. He told him that he understood the\\nScotch mountains were very near as fine as Switzerland, and that he\\nhoped to see them some day, though the curious prejudices about Sunday\\nand the whisky-drinking must come very much in the way of closer\\nintercourse; at which speech Colinâ\\x80\\x99s indignation and amusement would\\nhave been wonderful to see, had any one been there who cared to notice\\nhow the lad was looking. On the Sundays, Colin and his pupil went along\\nthe level ways to the quaint old mossy church, to which this same curate\\nwas devoting all his time and thoughts by way of restoration. The Scotch\\nyouth had never seen anything at once so homely and so noble as this\\nlittle church in the fen-country. He thought it nothing less than a poem\\nin stone, a pathetic old psalm of human life and death, joining in for\\never and ever, with the tenderest, sad responses, in the worship of\\nheaven. Never anywhere had he felt so clearly how the dead were waiting\\nfor the great Easter to come, nor seen Christianity standing so plainly\\nbetween the beginning and the end; but when Colin, with his Scotch\\nideas, heard the curious little sermons to which his curate gave\\nutterance under that roof, all consecrated and holy with the sorrows and\\nhopes of ages, it made the strangest anti-climax in the youthâ\\x80\\x99s\\nthoughts. He laughed to himself when he came out, not because he was\\ndisposed to laughter, but because it was the only alternative he had;\\nand Sir Thomas, who had a glimmering perception that this must be\\nsomething new to his inexperienced guest, gave a doubtful sort of smile,\\nnot knowing how to take Colinâ\\x80\\x99s strange looks.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in saintsâ\\x80\\x99 days, and such like, in Scotland?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe perplexed baronet; â\\x80\\x9cand of course the sermon does not count for so\\nmuch with us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, it does not count for much,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and they did not enter\\nfurther into the subject.\\n\\nAs for the young man himself, who had still upon his mind the feeling\\nthat he was to be a Scotch minister, the lesson was the strangest\\npossible; for, being Scotch, he could not help listening to the sermon\\naccording to the usage of his nation. The curate, after he had said\\nthose prayers which are all but divine in their comprehension of the\\nwants of humanity, told his people how wonderfully their beloved Church\\nhad provided for all their wants; how sweet it was to recollect that\\nthis was the day which had been appointed the Twentieth Sunday after\\nTrinity--and how it was their duty to meditate a fact so touching and so\\nimportant. Colin thought of the Holy Loch, and the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s critics\\nthere, and laughed to himself, perhaps a little bitterly. He felt as if\\nhe had given up his own career--the natural life to which he was born;\\nand at this distance the usual enchantments of nature began to work, and\\nin his heart he asked himself what he was to gain by transferring his\\nlot and hopes to this wealthy country, where so many things were fairer,\\nand after which he had been hankering so long. The curateâ\\x80\\x99s sermons\\nstruck him as a kind of comical climax to his disappointments--and the\\ncurate himself who looked at Colin much as he might have looked at a\\nSouth-Sea Islander, and spoke of the Scotch whisky and Scotch Sabbaths.\\nPoor curate! He knew a great deal more than Colin did about some things,\\nand, if he did not understand how to preach, that was not the fault of\\nhis college; neither did they convey much information at that seat of\\nlearning about the northern half of the British island--no more than\\nthey did at Glasgow about the curious specimen of humanity which is\\nknown as a curate on the brighter side of the Tweed.\\n\\nAll these things went through Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind as he sat in the dining-room\\nafter dinner contemplating Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s nap, which was not of itself an\\nelevating spectacle. He thought to himself at that moment that he was\\nbut fulfilling the office of a drudge at Wodensbourne, which anybody\\ncould fill. It did not require those abilities which had won with\\nacclamation the prize in the philosophy class to teach Charley Frankland\\nthe elements of science; and all the emulations and glories of his\\ncollege career came back to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind. The little public of the\\nUniversity had begun to think of him--to predict what he would do, and\\nanticipate his success, at home; but here, who knew anything about him?\\nThese thoughts disturbed him much as he sat watching the fire gleam in\\nthe wainscot, and calculating the recurrence of that next great snore\\nwhich would wake Sir Thomas, and make him sit up of a sudden and look\\nfiercely at his companion before he murmured out a â\\x80\\x9cBeg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d\\nand went to sleep again. Not an interesting prospect certainly. Should\\nhe go home? should he represent to the baronet, when he woke up for the\\nnight, that it had all been a mistake, and that his present office was\\nperfectly unsuited to his ambition and his hopes? But then what could he\\nsay? for after all it was as Charley Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s tutor simply, and with\\nhis eyes open, that he came to Wodensbourne, and Sir Thomas had said\\nnothing about the society of his niece, or any other society, to tempt\\nhim thither. Colin sat in a bitterness of discontent, which would have\\nbeen incredible to him a few weeks before, pondering these questions.\\nThere was not a sound to be heard, but the dropping of the ashes on the\\nhearth, and Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s heavy breathing as he slept. Life went on\\nvelvet slippers in the great house from which Colin would gladly have\\nescaped (he thought) to the poorest cottage on the Holy Loch. He could\\nnot help recalling his shabby little room in Glasgow, and Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlong comments upon life, and all the talk and the thoughts that made\\nexistence bright in that miserable little place, which Sir Thomas\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s grooms would not have condescended to live in, but which the\\nunfortunate young tutor thought of with longing as he sat dreary in the\\ngreat dining-room. What did it matter to him that the floor was soft\\nwith Turkey carpets, that the wine on the table was of the most renowned\\nvintages, and that his slumbering companion in the great easy-chair was\\nthe head of one of the oldest commoner families in England--a baronet\\nand a county member? Colin after all was only a son of the soil; he\\nlonged for his Glasgow attic, and his companions who spoke the dialect\\nof that remarkable but unlovely city, and felt bitterly in his heart\\nthat he had been cheated. Yet it was hard to say to any one--hard even\\nto put in words to himself--what the cheat was. It was a deception he\\nhad practised on himself, and in the bitterness of his disappointment\\nthe youth refused to admit that anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s absence was the secret of his\\nmortification. What was she to him?--a great lady as far out of his\\nreach as the moon or the stars, and who no doubt had forgotten his very\\nname.\\n\\nThese were not pleasant thoughts to season the solitude, and he sat\\nhugging them for a great many evenings before Sir Thomas awoke, and\\naddressed, as he generally did, a few good-humoured, stupid observations\\nto the lad whom, to be sure, the baronet found a considerable bore, and\\ndid not know what to do with. Sir Thomas could not forget his\\nobligations to the young man who had saved Harryâ\\x80\\x99s life; and thus it\\nwas, from pure gratitude, that he made Colin miserable--though there was\\nno gratitude at all, nor even much respect, in the summary judgment\\nwhich the youth formed of the heavy â\\x80\\x99squire.\\n\\nThis was how matters were going on when Wodensbourne and the world, and\\neverything human, suddenly, all at once, sustained again a change to\\nColin. He had been living thus, for six weary weeks--during which time\\nhe felt himself getting morose, ill-tempered, and miserable--writing\\nsharp letters home, in which he would not confess to any special\\ndisappointment, but expressed himself in general terms of bitterness\\nlike a young misanthrope, and in every respect making himself, and those\\nwho cared for him, unhappy. Even the verses, which did very well to\\nexpress the tender griefs of sentiment, had been thrown aside at this\\ncrisis; for there was nothing melodious in his feelings, and he could\\nnot say in sweet rhymes and musical cadences how angry and wretched he\\nwas. He was sitting in such a mood one dreary December evening when it\\nwas raining fast outside and everything was silent within--as was\\nnatural in a well-regulated household where the servants knew their\\nduty, and the nursery was half a mile away through worlds of complicated\\npassages. Sir Thomas was asleep as usual, and, with his eyes shut and\\nhis mouth open, the excellent baronet was not, as we have already said,\\nan elevating spectacle; and, at the other end of the table, sat Colin,\\nchafing out his young soul with such thoughts of what was not, but might\\nhave been, as youth does not know how to avoid. It was just then, when\\nhe was going over his long succession of miseries--thinking of his\\nnatural career cut short for the sake of this dreary penance of which\\nnothing could ever come--that Colin was startled by the sound of wheels\\ncoming up the wintry avenue. He could not venture to imagine to himself\\nwhat it might be, though he listened as if for life and death; he heard\\nthe sounds of an arrival and the indistinct hum of voices which he could\\nnot distinguish, without feeling that he had any right to stir from the\\ntable to inquire what it meant; and there he sat accordingly, with his\\nhair thrust back from his forehead and his great eyes gleaming out from\\nthe noiseless atmosphere, when the door opened and a pretty figure, all\\neager and glowing with life, looked into the room. Colin was too much\\nabsorbed, too anxious, and felt too deeply how much was involved, to be\\ncapable even of rising up to greet her as an indifferent man would have\\ndone. He sat and gazed at her as she darted in like a fairy creature,\\nbringing every kind of radiance in her train.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere they are, aunty!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Matty; and she came in flying in her\\ncloak, with the hood still over her head and great raindrops on it,\\nwhich she had caught as she jumped out of the carriage. While Colin sat\\ngazing at her, wondering if it was some deluding apparition, or, in\\nreality, the new revelation of life and love that it seemed to be, Matty\\nhad thrown herself upon Sir Thomas and woke the worthy baronet by\\nkissing him, which was a pretty sight to behold. â\\x80\\x9cHere we are, uncle;\\nwake up!â\\x80\\x9d cried Matty; â\\x80\\x9cmy lady ran to the nursery first, but I came to\\nyou, as I always do.â\\x80\\x9d And the little witch looked up at Colin, with a\\nglance under which heaven and earth changed to the lad. He stumbled to\\nhis feet, while Sir Thomas rubbed his astonished eyes. What could Colin\\nsay? He stood waiting for a word, seeing the little figure in a halo of\\nlight and fanciful glory. â\\x80\\x9cHow do you do? I knew you were here,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMiss Matty, putting out two fingers to him while she still hung over her\\nuncle. And presently Lady Frankland came in, and the room became full of\\npleasant din and commotion as was inevitable. When Colin made a move as\\nif to leave them, fearful of being in the way, Miss Matty called to him,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, donâ\\x80\\x99t go, please; we are going to have tea, and my lady must be\\nserved without giving her any trouble, and I want you to help me,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMatty; and so the evening that had begun in gloom ended in a kind of\\nsubdued glory too sweet to be real; surely too good to be true.\\n\\nLady Frankland sat talking to her husband of their reason for coming\\nback so suddenly (which was sad enough, being an unexpected death in\\nthe house: but that did not make much difference to the two women who\\nwere coming home); Matty kept coming and going between the tea-table and\\nthe fire, sending Colin on all sorts of errands, and making comments to\\nhim aside on what her aunt was saying. â\\x80\\x9cOnly fancy the long dreary drive\\nwe have had, and my uncle and Mr. Campbell making themselves so cozy,â\\x80\\x9d\\nthe little siren said, kneeling down before the fire with still one drop\\nof rain sparkling on her bright locks. And the effect was such that\\nColin lost his head altogether, and could not have affirmed, had he been\\nquestioned on his oath, that he had not enjoyed himself greatly all the\\ntime. He took Lady Frankland her tea, and listened to all the domestic\\nchatter as if it had been the talk of angels; and was as pleased when\\nthe mistress of the house thanked him for his kindness to Charley, as if\\nhe had not thought Charley a wretched little nuisance a few hours ago.\\nHe did not in the least know who the people were about whom the two\\nladies kept up such an unceasing talk, and, perhaps, under other\\ncircumstances would have laughed at this sweet-toned gossip, with all\\nits lively comments upon nothing, and incessant personalities; but, at\\nthe present moment, Colin had said good-bye to reason, and could not\\nanyhow defend himself against the sudden happiness which seized upon him\\nwithout any notice. While Sir Thomas and his wife sat on either side of\\nthe great fire, and Matty kept darting in and out between them, Colin\\nsat behind near the impromptu tea-table, and listened and felt that the\\nworld was changed. If he could have had time to think, he might have\\nbeen ashamed of himself; but then he had no time to think, and in the\\nmeantime he was happy, a sensation not to be gainsaid or rejected; and\\nso fled the few blessed hours of the first evening of Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s return.\\n\\nWhen he had gone up stairs, and had heard, at a distance, the sound of\\nthe last good-night, and was fairly shut up again in the silence of his\\nown room, the youth, for the first time, began to realize what he was\\ndoing. He paused, with a little consternation, a little fright, to\\nquestion himself. For the first time, he saw clearly, without any\\npossibility of self-delusion, what it was which had brought him here,\\nand which made all the difference to him between happiness and misery.\\nIt was hard to realize now the state of mind he had been in a few hours\\nbefore; but he did it, by dint of a great exertion, and saw, with a\\ndistinctness which alarmed him, how it was that everything had altered\\nin his eyes. It was Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s presence that made all the difference\\nbetween this subdued thrill of happiness and that blank of impatient and\\nmortified misery. The young man tried to stand still and consider the\\nreality of his position. He had stopped in his career, made a voluntary\\npause in his life, entered upon a species of existence which he felt in\\nhis heart was not more, but less, noble (for him) than his previous\\ncourse--and what was it for? All for the uncertain smile, for the\\nsociety--which might fail him at any time--of a woman so far out of his\\nway, so utterly removed from his reach, as Matilda Frankland? For a\\nmoment, the youth was dismayed, and stopped short, Wisdom and Truth\\nwhispering in his ear. Love might be fair, but he knew enough to know\\nthat life must not be subservient to that witchery; and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s good\\nangel spoke to him in the silence, and bade him flee. Better to go back,\\nand at once, to the grey and sombre world, where all his duties awaited\\nhim, than to stay here in this foolâ\\x80\\x99s paradise. As he thought so he got\\nup, and began to pace about his room, as though it had been a cage. Best\\nto flee--it might take all the light out of his life and break his\\nheart, but what else had he to look for sooner or later? He sat up half\\nthe night, still pacing about his room, hesitating over his fate, while\\nthe December storm raged outside. What was he to do? When he dropped to\\nsleep at last, his heart betrayed him, and strayed away into celestial\\nworlds of dreaming. He woke, still undecided, as he thought, to see the\\nearliest wintry gleam of sunshine stealing in through his shutters. What\\nwas he to do? But already the daylight made him feel his terrors as so\\nmany shadows. His heart was a traitor, and he was glad to find it so;\\nand that moment of indecision settled more surely than ever the bondage\\nin which he seemed to have entangled his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV.\\n\\n\\nFrom that day life flew upon celestial wings for Charley Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s\\ntutor. It was not that love-making proved possible, or that existence at\\nWodensbourne became at all what it had been at Ardmartin. The difference\\nwas in the atmosphere, which was now bright with all kinds of gladsome\\nchances, and pervaded by anticipations--a charm which, at Colinâ\\x80\\x99s age,\\nwas more than reality. He never knew what moment of delight might come\\nto him any day--what words might be said, or smiles shed upon him. Such\\nan enchantment could not, indeed, have lasted very long; but, in the\\nmeantime, it was infinitely sweet, and made his life like a romance to\\nthe young man. There was nobody at Wodensbourne to occupy Miss Matty, or\\nwithdraw her attention from her young worshipper; and Colin, with his\\npoetic temperament, and his youthful genius, and all the simplicities\\nand inexperience which rendered him so different from the other clever\\nyoung men who had been seen or heard of in that region, was very\\ndelightful company, even when he was not engaged in any acts of worship.\\nLady Frankland herself acknowledged that Mr. Campbell was a great\\nacquisition. â\\x80\\x9cHe is not the least like other people,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady of\\nthe house; â\\x80\\x9cbut you must take care not to let him fall in love with you,\\nMatty;â\\x80\\x9d and both the ladies laughed softly as they sat over their cup of\\ntea. As for Matty, when she went to dress for dinner, after that\\nadmonition, she put on tartan ribbons over her white dress, partly, to\\nbe sure, because they were the fashion; but chiefly to please Colin, who\\nknew rather less about tartan than she did, and had not the remotest\\nidea that the many-coloured sash had any reference to himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI love Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d the little witch said to him, when he came into the\\ndrawing-room, to which he was now admitted during Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s nap--and,\\nto tell the truth, Lady Frankland herself had just closed her eyes in a\\ngentle doze, in her easy chair--â\\x80\\x9cbut, though you are a Scotchman, you\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t take the least notice of my ribbons; I am very fond of Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Matty;--â\\x80\\x9cand the Scotch,â\\x80\\x9d the wicked little girl added, with a\\nglance at him, which made Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart leap in his deluded breast.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen I am very glad to be Scotch,â\\x80\\x9d said the youth, and stooped down\\nover the end of the sash till Matty thought he meant to kiss it, which\\nwas a more decided act of homage than it would be expedient, under the\\ncircumstances, to permit.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t talk like everybody else,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty; â\\x80\\x9cthat does not make\\nany difference--you were always glad to be Scotch. I know you all think\\nyou are so much better and cleverer than we are in England. But, tell\\nme, do you still mean to be a Scotch minister? I wish you would not,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Matty, with a little pout. And then Colin laughed--half with\\npleasure at what he thought her interest in him, and half with a quaint\\nrecollection which belonged only to himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think I could preach about the twentieth Sunday after\\nTrinity,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a smile; which, however, was a speech Miss Matty\\ndid not understand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople here donâ\\x80\\x99t preach as you do in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said the English girl,\\nwith a little offence. â\\x80\\x9cYou are always preaching, and that is what makes\\nit so dull. But what is the good of being a minister? There are plenty\\nof dull people to be ministers; you who are so clever--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAm I clever?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI am Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor--it does not require a\\ngreat deal of genius--â\\x80\\x9d but while he spoke, his eyes--which Matty did\\nnot comprehend, which always went leagues further than she could\\nfollow--kindled up a little. He looked a long way beyond her, and no\\ndoubt he saw something; but it piqued her not to be able to follow him,\\nand find out what he meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you had done what I wished, and gone to Oxford, Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir\\nThomas, whose repose had been interrupted earlier than usual; â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsay much about what I could have done myself, for I have heaps of boys\\nof my own to provide for; but, if youâ\\x80\\x99re bent on going into the Church,\\nsomething would certainly have turned up for you. I donâ\\x80\\x99t say thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmuch of a career in the Church for an ambitious young fellow, but still,\\nif you do work well and have a few friends--. As for your Scotch Church,\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know very much about it,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet, candidly. â\\x80\\x9cI never\\nknew any one who did. What a bore it used to be a dozen years ago, when\\nthere was all that row; and now, I suppose, youâ\\x80\\x99re all at sixes and\\nsevens, ainâ\\x80\\x99t you?â\\x80\\x9d asked the ingenuous legislator. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose whisky\\nand controversy go together somehow.â\\x80\\x9d Sir Thomas got himself packed into\\nthe corner of a sofa very comfortably, as he spoke, and took no notice\\nof the lightning in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, uncle! donâ\\x80\\x99t,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t you know that the\\nPresbyterians are all going to give up and join the Church? and itâ\\x80\\x99s all\\nto be the same both in England and Scotland? You need not laugh. I\\nassure you I know quite well what I am saying,â\\x80\\x9d said the little beauty,\\nwith a look of dignity. â\\x80\\x9cI have seen it in the papers; such funny\\npapers!--with little paragraphs about accidents, and about people\\ngetting silver snuff-boxes!--but all the same, they say what I tell you.\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s to be no Presbyterians and no precentors, and none of their\\nwicked ways, coming into church with their hats on, and staring all\\nround instead of saying their prayers; and all the ministers are to be\\nmade into clergymen--priests and deacons, you know; and they are going\\nto have bishops and proper service like other people. Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Matty, looking up at him with a little emphasis, to mark that, for\\nonce, she was calling him formally by his name--â\\x80\\x9cknows it is quite\\ntrue.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHumph,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, â\\x80\\x9cI know better; I know how Campbell, there,\\nlooked the other day when he came out of church. I know the Scotch and\\ntheir ways of thinking. Go and make the tea, and donâ\\x80\\x99t talk of what you\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t understand. But, as for you, Campbell, if you have a mind for the\\nUniversity and to go in for the Church--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut this was more than Colin, being twenty, and a Scotchman, could bear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI _am_ going in for the Church,â\\x80\\x9d said the lad, doing all he could to\\nkeep down the excitement at which Sir Thomas would have laughed, â\\x80\\x9cbut it\\ndid not in the least touch my heart the other day to know that it was\\nthe twentieth Sunday after Trinity. Devotion is a great matter,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe young Scotchman, â\\x80\\x9cI grant you have the advantage over us there; but\\nit would not do in Scotland to preach about the Churchâ\\x80\\x99s goodness, and\\nwhat she had appointed for such or such a day. We preach very stupid\\nsermons, I dare say; but at least we mean to teach somebody\\nsomething--what God looks for at their hands, or what they may look for\\nat His. It is more an occupation for a man,â\\x80\\x9d cried the young\\nrevolutionary, â\\x80\\x9cthan reading the sublimest of prayers. I am going in for\\nthe Church--but it is the Church of Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He drew\\nhimself up with a grand youthful dignity, which was much lost on Sir\\nThomas, who, for his part, looked at his new tutor with eyes of sober\\nwonderment, and did not understand what this emotion meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no occasion for excitement,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet; â\\x80\\x9cnobody\\nnow-a-days meddles with a manâ\\x80\\x99s convictions; indeed, Harry would say,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s a great thing to have any convictions. That is how the young men\\ntalk now-a-days,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas; and he moved off the sofa again, and\\nyawned, though not uncivilly. As for Miss Matty, she came stealing up\\nwhen she had made the tea, with her cup in her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSo you do mean to be a minister?â\\x80\\x9d she said, in a half whisper, with a\\ndeprecating look. Lady Frankland had roused up, like her husband, and\\nthe two were talking, and did not take any notice of Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s proceedings\\nwith the harmless tutor. The young lady was quite free to play with her\\nmouse a little, and entered upon the amusement with zest, as was\\nnatural. â\\x80\\x9cYou mean to shut yourself up in a square house, with five\\nwindows in front, like the poor gentleman who has such red hair; and\\nnever see anybody but the old women in the parish, and have your life\\nmade miserable every Sunday by _that_ precentor--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope I have a soul above precentors,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a little\\nlaugh, which was unsteady still, however, with excitement; â\\x80\\x9cand one\\nmight mend all that,â\\x80\\x9d he added a minute after, looking at her with a\\nkind of wistful inquiry which he could not have put into words. What was\\nit he meant to ask with his anxious eye? But he did not himself know.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, â\\x80\\x9cI know what you could do: you could get a little\\norgan and marry somebody who would play it, and teach the people better;\\nI know exactly what you could do,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady with a piquant\\nlittle touch of spite, and a look that startled Colin; and then she\\npaused, and hung her head for a moment and blushed, or looked as if she\\nblushed. â\\x80\\x9cBut you would not?â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, softly, with a sidelong glance\\nat her victim. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t marry anybody; no one is of any use after that. I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t approve of marrying, for my part, especially for a priest. Priests\\nshould always be detached, you know, from the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He was quite content to go on talking on such a\\nsubject for any length of time. â\\x80\\x9cAs for marrying, it is only your rich\\nsquires and great people who can marry when they please; we who have to\\nmake our own way in the world--â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with a touch of\\ngrandeur, but was stopped by Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s sudden laughter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, how simple you are! As if rich squires and great people, as you\\nsay, could marry when they pleased--as if any man could marry when he\\npleased!â\\x80\\x9d cried Miss Matty, scornfully. â\\x80\\x9cAfter all, we do count for\\nsomething, we poor women; now and then, we can put even an eldest son\\nout in his calculations. It is great fun too,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady, and\\nshe laughed, and so did Colin, who could not help wondering what special\\ncase she might have in her eye, and listened with all the eagerness of a\\nlover. â\\x80\\x9cThere is poor Harry--â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty under her breath, and\\nstopped short and laughed to herself and sipped her tea, while Colin\\nlent an anxious ear. But nothing further followed that soft laughter.\\nColin sat on thorns, gazing at her with a world of questions in his\\nface, but the siren looked at him no more. Poor Harry! Harryâ\\x80\\x99s natural\\nrival was sensible of a thrill of jealous curiosity mingled with\\nanxiety. What had she done to Harry, this witch who had beguiled\\nColin?--or was it not she who had done anything to him, but some other\\nas pretty and as mischievous? Colin had no clue to the puzzle, but it\\ngave him a new _accÃ¨s_ of half-conscious enmity to the heir of\\nWodensbourne.\\n\\nAfter that talk there elapsed a few days during which Colin saw but\\nlittle of Matty, who had visits to pay, and some solemn dinner-parties\\nto attend in Lady Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s train. He had to spend the evenings by\\nhimself on these occasions after dining with Charley, who was not a very\\nagreeable companion; and, when this invalid went to his room, as he did\\nearly, the young tutor found himself desolate enough in the great house,\\nwhere no human bond existed between him and the little community within\\nits walls. He was not in a state of mind to take kindly to abstract\\nstudy at that moment of his existence, for Colin had passed out of the\\nunconscious stage in which he had been at Ardmartin. There, however much\\nhe might have wished to be out of temptation, he could not help himself,\\nwhich was a wonderful consolation; but now he had come wilfully and\\nknowingly into danger, and had become aware of it; and far more\\ndistinctly than ever before had become aware of the difference between\\nhimself and the object of his thoughts. Though he found it very possible\\nat times to comfort himself with the thought that this was an ordinary\\ninterruption of a Scotch studentâ\\x80\\x99s work, and noways represented the\\nArmidaâ\\x80\\x99s garden in which the knight lost both his vocation and his life,\\nthere were other moments and moods which were less easily manageable;\\nand, on the whole, he wanted the stimulus of perpetual excitement to\\nkeep him from feeling the false position he was in, and the inexpediency\\nof continuing it. Though this feeling haunted him all day, at night, in\\nthe drawing-room--which was brightened and made sweet by the fair\\nEnglish matron who was kind to Colin, and the fairer maiden who was the\\ncentre of all his thoughts--it vanished like an evil spirit, and left\\nhim with a sense that nowhere in the world could he have been so well;\\nbut, when the stimulus was withdrawn, the youth was left in a very\\nwoeful plight, conscious, to the bottom of his heart, that he ought to\\nbe elsewhere, and here was consuming his strength and life. He went out\\nin the darkness of the December nights through the gloomy silent park\\ninto the little village with its feeble lights, where everybody and\\neverything was unknown to him; and all the time his demon sat on his\\nshoulder and asked what he did there. One evening while he strayed\\nthrough the broken, irregular village-street, to all appearance looking\\nat the dim cottage-windows and listening to the rude songs from the\\nlittle ale-house, the curate encountered the tutor. Most probably the\\nyoung priest, who was not remarkable for wisdom, imagined the Scotch lad\\nto be in some danger; for he laid a kindly hand upon his arm and turned\\nhim away from the vociferous little tavern, which was a vexation to the\\ncurateâ\\x80\\x99s soul. â\\x80\\x9cI should like you to go up to the Parsonage with me, if\\nyou will only wait till I have seen this sick woman,â\\x80\\x9d he said; and Colin\\nwent in very willingly within the cottage porch to wait for his\\nacquaintance, who had his prayer-book under his arm. The young Scotchman\\nlooked on with wondering eyes while the village priest knelt down by his\\nparishionerâ\\x80\\x99s bedside and opened his book. Naturally there was a\\ncomparison always going on in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind. He was like a passive\\nexperimentalist, seeing all kinds of trials made before his eyes, and\\nwatching the result. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder if they all think it is a spell,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin to himself; but he was rebuked and was silent when he heard the\\nresponses which the cottage folk made on their knees. When the curate\\nhad read his prayer he got up and said good-night, and went back to\\nColin; and this visitation of the sick was a very strange experience to\\nthe young Scotch observer, who stood revolving everything, with an eye\\nto Scotland, at the cottage-door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t make use of our Common Prayer in Scotland?â\\x80\\x9d said the curate;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cpardon me for referring to it. One cannot help being sorry for people\\nwho shut themselves out from such an inestimable advantage. How did it\\ncome about?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose because Laud was a fool, and King\\nCharles a ----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush, for goodness sake,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate, with a shiver. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you\\nmean? such language is painful to listen to. The saints and martyrs\\nshould be spoken of in a different tone. You think that was the reason?\\nOh, no; it was your horrible Calvinism, and John Knox, and the mad\\ninfluences of that unfortunate Reformation which has done us all so much\\nharm; though I suppose you think differently in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d he said with\\na little sigh, steering his young companion, of whose morality he felt\\nuncertain, past the alehouse door.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you never hear of John Knoxâ\\x80\\x99s liturgy?â\\x80\\x9d said the indignant Colin;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe saddest, passionate service! You always had time to say your\\nprayers in England, but we had to snatch them as we could. And your\\nprayers would not do for us now,â\\x80\\x9d said the Scotch experimentalist; â\\x80\\x9cI\\nwish they could; but it would be impossible. A Scotch peasant would have\\nthought _that_ an incantation you were reading. When you go to see a\\nsick man, shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t you like to say, God save him, God forgive him,\\nstraight out of your heart without a book?â\\x80\\x9d said the eager lad; at which\\nquestion the curate looked up with wonder in the young manâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope I do say it out of my heart,â\\x80\\x9d said the English priest, and\\nstopped short, with a gravity that had a great effect upon Colin;--â\\x80\\x9cbut\\nin words more sound than any words of mine,â\\x80\\x9d the curate added a moment\\nafter, which dispersed the reverential impression from the Scotch mind\\nof the eager boy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t see that,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, quickly, â\\x80\\x9cin the church for common\\nprayer, yes; at a bedside in a cottage, no. At least, I mean thatâ\\x80\\x99s how\\nwe feel in Scotland--though I suppose you donâ\\x80\\x99t care much for our\\nopinion,â\\x80\\x9d he added with some heat, thinking he saw a smile on his\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, certainly; I have always understood that there is a great deal\\nof intelligence in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate, courteous as to a\\nSouth-Sea Islander. â\\x80\\x9cBut people who have never known this inestimable\\nadvantage--I believe preaching is considered the great thing in the\\nNorth?â\\x80\\x9d he said with a little curiosity. â\\x80\\x9cI wish society were a little\\nmore impressed by it among ourselves; but mere _information_ even about\\nspiritual matters is of so much less importance! though that, I daresay,\\nis another point on which we donâ\\x80\\x99t agree?â\\x80\\x9d the curate continued,\\npleasantly. He was just opening the gate into his own garden, which was\\ninvisible in the darkness, but which enclosed and surrounded a homely\\nhouse with some lights in the windows, which, it was a little comfort to\\nColin to perceive, was not much handsomer nor more imposing in\\nappearance than the familiar manse on the borders of the Holy Loch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt depends on what you call spiritual matters,â\\x80\\x9d said the polemical\\nyouth. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think a man can possibly get too much information about\\nhis relations with God, if only anybody could tell him anything; but\\ncertainly about ecclesiastical arrangements and the Christian year,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the irreverent young Scotchman, â\\x80\\x9ca little might suffice;â\\x80\\x9d and Colin\\nspoke with the slightest inflection of contempt, always thinking of the\\ntwentieth Sunday after Trinity, and scorning what he did not understand,\\nas was natural to his years.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you are saying,â\\x80\\x9d said the devout curate. â\\x80\\x9cAfter\\nyou have spent a Christian Year, you will see what comfort and beauty\\nthere is in it. You say, â\\x80\\x98if anybody could tell him anything.â\\x80\\x99 I hope\\nyou have not got into a sceptical way of thinking. I should like very\\nmuch to have a long talk with you,â\\x80\\x9d said the village priest, who was\\nvery good and very much in earnest, though the earnestness was after a\\npattern different from anything known to Colin; and, before the youth\\nperceived what was going to happen, he found himself in the curateâ\\x80\\x99s\\nstudy, placed on a kind of moral platform, as the emblem of Doubt and\\nthat pious unbelief which is the favourite of modern theology. Now, to\\ntell the truth, Colin, though it may lower him in the opinion of many\\nreaders of his history, was not by nature given to doubting. He had, to\\nbe sure, followed the fashion of the time enough to be aware of a\\nwonderful amount of unsettled questions, and questions which it did not\\nappear possible ever to settle. But somehow these elements of scepticism\\ndid not give him much trouble. His heart was full of natural piety, and\\nhis instincts all fresh and strong as a childâ\\x80\\x99s. He could not help\\nbelieving, any more than he could help breathing, his nature being such;\\nand he was half-amused and half-irritated by the position in which he\\nfound himself, notwithstanding the curateâ\\x80\\x99s respect for the ideal\\nsceptic, whom he had thus pounced upon. The commonplace character of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s mind was such, that he was very glad when his new friend relaxed\\ninto gossip, and asked him who was expected at the Hall for Christmas;\\nto which the tutor answered by such names as he had heard in the ladiesâ\\x80\\x99\\ntalk, and remembered with friendliness or with jealousy, according to\\nthe feeling with which Miss Matty pronounced them--which was Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nonly guide amid this crowd of the unknown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder if it is to be a match,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate, who, recovering from\\nhis dread concerning the possible habits of his Scotch guest, had taken\\nheart to share his scholarly potations of beer with his new friend. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\nwas said Lady Frankland did not like it, but I never believed that.\\nAfter all, it was such a natural arrangement. I wonder if it is to be a\\nmatch?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs what to be a match?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who all at once felt his heart\\nstand still and grow cold, though he sat by the cheerful fire which\\nthrew its light even into the dark garden outside. â\\x80\\x9cI have heard nothing\\nabout any match,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a little effort. It dawned upon him\\ninstantly what it must be, and his impulse was to rush out of the house\\nor do something rash and sudden that would prevent him from hearing it\\nsaid in words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBetween Henry Frankland and his cousin,â\\x80\\x9d said the calm curate; â\\x80\\x9cthey\\nlooked as if they were perfectly devoted to each other at one time. That\\nhas died off, for she is rather a flirt, I fear; but all the people\\nhereabouts had made up their minds on the subject. It would be a very\\nsuitable match on the whole. But why do you get up? you are not going\\naway?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes; I have something to do when I go home,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9csomething to\\nprepare,â\\x80\\x9d which he said out of habit, thinking of his old work, at home,\\nwithout remembering what he was saying or whether it meant anything. The\\ncurate put down the poker which he had lifted to poke the fire, and\\nlooked at Colin with a touch of envy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh! something literary, I suppose?â\\x80\\x9d said the young priest, and went\\nwith his new friend to the door thinking how lucky he was, at his age,\\nto have a literary connexion; a thought very natural to a young priest\\nin a country curacy with a very small endowment. The curate wrote\\nverses, as Colin himself did, though on very different subjects, and\\ntook some of them out of his desk and looked at them, after he had shut\\nthe door, with affectionate eyes, and a half intention of asking the\\ntutor what was the best way to get admission to the magazines; and on\\nthe whole he was pleased with what he had seen of the young Scotchman,\\nthough he was so ignorant of church matters; an opinion which Colin\\nperfectly reciprocated, with a more distinct sentiment of compassion for\\nthe English curate, who knew about as much of Scotland as if it had lain\\nin the South Seas.\\n\\nMeanwhile Colin walked home to Wodensbourne with fire and passion in his\\nheart. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be a very suitable match on the whole,â\\x80\\x9d he kept saying\\nto himself, and then tried to take a little comfort from Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s sweet\\nlaughter over â\\x80\\x9cPoor Harry!â\\x80\\x9d Poor Harry was rich and fortunate, and\\nindependent, and Colin was only the tutor; were these two to meet this\\nChristmas time and contend over again on this new ground? He went along\\npast the black trees as if he were walking for a wager; but, quick as he\\nwalked, a dog-cart dashed past him with lighted lamps gleaming up the\\navenue. When he reached the Hall-door, one of the servants was\\ndisappearing up stairs with a portmanteau, and a heap of coats and\\nwrappers lay in the Hall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Harry just come, sir--a week sooner than was expected,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nbutler, who was an old servant and shared in the joys of the family.\\nColin went to his room without a word, and shut himself up there with\\nfeelings which he could not have explained to any one. He had not seen\\nHarry Frankland since they were both boys; but he had never got over the\\nyouthful sense of rivalry and opposition which had sent him skimming\\nover the waters of the Holy Loch to save the boy who was his born rival\\nand antagonist. Was this the day of their encounter and conflict which\\nhad come at last?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI.\\n\\n\\nHarry Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s return made a great difference to the tutor, between\\nwhom and the heir of the house there existed that vague sense of\\njealousy and rivalship which was embittered on the part of young\\nFrankland by a certain consciousness of obligation. He was a\\ngood-natured fellow enough, and above the meanness of treating unkindly\\nanybody who was in a dependent position; but the circumstances were\\nawkward, and he did not know how to comport himself towards the\\nstranger. â\\x80\\x9cThe fellow looks like a gentleman,â\\x80\\x9d he said privately in\\nconfidence to his mother; â\\x80\\x9cif I had never seen him before we might have\\ngot on, you know; but itâ\\x80\\x99s a horrible nuisance to feel that youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nobliged to a fellow in that kind of position--neither your equal, you\\nknow, nor your inferior, nor--. What on earth induced the governor to\\nhave him here? If it hadnâ\\x80\\x99t been for these cheap Scotch universities and\\nstuff, heâ\\x80\\x99d have been a ploughman that one could have given ten pounds\\nto and been done with him. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a confounded nuisance having him here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush, Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cHe is very nice and very\\ngentlemanly, I think. He used to be very amusing before you came home.\\nPapa, you know, is not entertaining after dinner; and really Mr.\\nCampbell was quite an acquisition, especially to Matty, who canâ\\x80\\x99t live\\nwithout a slave,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady of the house, with an indulgent,\\nmatronly smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, confound it, why did the governor have him here?â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\ndiscontented heir. â\\x80\\x9cAs for Matty, it appears to me she had better begin\\nto think of doing without slaves,â\\x80\\x9d he said moodily, with a cloud on his\\nface; a speech which made his mother look up with a quick movement of\\nanxiety, though she still smiled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t make out either you or Matty,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cI wish you\\nwould be either off or on. With such an appearance of indifference as\\nyou show to each other--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indifference, by Jove!â\\x80\\x9d said Harry, breaking in upon his motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwords; and the young man gave a short whistle, and, jumping up abruptly,\\nwent off without waiting for any more. Lady Frankland was not in the\\nhabit of disturbing herself about things in general. She looked after\\nher son with a serious look, which, however, lasted but a moment. Then\\nshe returned immediately to her placidity and her needlework. â\\x80\\x9cI daresay\\nit will come all right,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, with serene philosophy,\\nwhich perhaps accounted for the absence of wrinkles in her comely,\\nmiddle-aged countenance. Harry, on the contrary, went off in anything\\nbut a serene state of mind. It was a foggy day, and the clouds lay very\\nlow and heavy over the fen-country, where there was nothing to relieve\\nthe dulness of nature. And it was afternoon--the very time of the day\\nwhen all hopes and attempts at clearing up are over--and dinner was\\nstill too far off to throw its genial glow upon the dusky house. There\\nhad been nothing going on for a day or two at Wodensbourne. Harry was\\nbefore his time, and the expected guests had not yet arrived, and the\\nweather was as troublesome and hindersome of every kind of recreation as\\nweather could possibly be. Young Frankland went out in a little fit of\\nimpatience, and was met at the hall-door by a mouthful of dense white\\nsteaming air, through which even the jovial trees of holly, all glowing\\nwith Christmas berries, loomed like two prickly ghosts. He uttered an\\nexclamation of disgust as he stood on the broad stone steps, not quite\\nsure what to do with himself--whether to face the chill misery of the\\nair outside, or to hunt up Matty and Charley, and betake himself to the\\nbilliard-room within. But then the tutor--confound the fellow! Just at\\nthat moment Harry Frankland heard a laugh, a provoking little peal of\\nsilver bells. He had an odd sort of affection--half love, half\\ndislike--for his cousin. But of all Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s charms, there was none which\\nso tantalized and bewitched him as this laugh, which was generally\\nacknowledged to be charming. â\\x80\\x9cMuch there is to laugh about, by Jove!â\\x80\\x9d he\\nmuttered to himself, with an angry flush; but he grew grimly furious\\nwhen he heard her voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou wonâ\\x80\\x99t give in,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty; â\\x80\\x9cthe Scotch never will, I know; you are\\nall so dreadfully argumentative and quarrelsome. But you are beaten,\\nthough you wonâ\\x80\\x99t acknowledge it; you know you are. I like talking to\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d continued the little witch, dropping her voice a little,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbecause--hush! I thought I heard some one calling me from the house.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBecause why?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. They were a good way off, behind one of those\\ngreat holly trees; but young Frankland, with his quickened ears,\\ndiscerned in an instant the softness, the tender admiration, the music\\nof the tutorâ\\x80\\x99s voice. â\\x80\\x9cBy Jove!â\\x80\\x9d said the heir to himself; and then he\\nshouted out, â\\x80\\x9cMatty, look here! come here!â\\x80\\x9d in tones as different from\\nthose of Colin as discord is from harmony. It did not occur to him that\\nMiss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s ear, being perfectly cool and unexcited, was quite able to\\ndiscriminate between the two voices which thus claimed her regard.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you want?â\\x80\\x9d said Matty. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t stand there in the fog like a\\nghost; if you have anything to say, come here. I am taking my\\nconstitutional; oneâ\\x80\\x99s first duty is the care of oneâ\\x80\\x99s health,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nwicked little creature, with her ring of laughter; and she turned back\\nagain under his very eyes along the terrace without looking at him\\nagain. As for Harry Frankland, the words which escaped from his excited\\nlips were not adapted for publication. If he had been a little less\\nangry he would have joined them, and so made an end of the tutor; but,\\nbeing furious, and not understanding anything about it, he burst for a\\nmoment into profane language, and then went off to the stables, where\\nall the people had a bad time of it until the dressing-bell rang.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat a savage he is,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, confidentially. â\\x80\\x9cThat is the bore of\\ncousins; they canâ\\x80\\x99t bear to see one happy, and yet they wonâ\\x80\\x99t take the\\ntrouble of making themselves agreeable. How nice it used to be down at\\nKilchurn _that_ summer--you remember? And what quantities of poetry you\\nused to write. I suppose Wodensbourne is not favourable to poetry? You\\nhave never shown me anything since you came here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoetry is only for oneâ\\x80\\x99s youth,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cthat is, if you dignify\\nmy verses with the name--for oneâ\\x80\\x99s extreme youth, when one believes in\\neverything that is impossible; and for Kilchurn, and the Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s Glen,\\nand the Holy Loch,â\\x80\\x9d said the youth, after a pause, with a fervour which\\ndisconcerted Matty. â\\x80\\x9c_That_ summer was not summer, but a bit of\\nparadise--and life is real at Wodensbourne.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you would not speak in riddles,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, who was in the\\nhumour to have a little more of this inferred worship. â\\x80\\x9cI should have\\nthought life was a great deal more real at Ramore than here. Here we\\nhave luxuries and things--and--and--and books and--.â\\x80\\x9d She meant to have\\nimplied that the homely life was hard, and to have delicately intimated\\nto Colin the advantage of living under the roof of Sir Thomas Frankland;\\nbut, catching his eye at the outset of her sentence, Matty had suddenly\\nperceived her mistake, and broke down in a way most unusual to her. As\\nshe floundered, the young man looked at her with a full unhesitating\\ngaze, and an incomprehensible smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d he said--he had scarcely ever attempted before to take the\\nsuperiority out of her hands, little trifler and fine lady as she\\nwas--he had been quite content to lay himself down in the dust and\\nsuffer her to march over him in airy triumph. But, while she was only a\\nlittle tricksy coquette, taking from his imagination all her higher\\ncharms, Colin was a true man, a man full of young genius, and faculties\\na world beyond anything known to Matty; and, when he was roused for the\\nmoment, it was so easy for him to confound her paltry pretensions.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with the smile which piqued her, which she did not\\nunderstand; â\\x80\\x9cI think you mistake. At Ramore I was a poor farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nbut we had other things to think of than the difference between wealth\\nand poverty. At Ramore we think nothing impossible; but here--â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin, looking round him with a mixture of contempt and admiration,\\nwhich Matty could not comprehend. â\\x80\\x9cThat, you perceive, was the age of\\npoetry, the age of romance, the golden age,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with a\\nsmile. â\\x80\\x9cThe true knight required nothing but his sword, and was more\\nthan a match for all kinds of ugly kings and wicked enchanters; but\\nWodensbourne is prose, hard prose--fine English if you like, and much to\\nbe applauded for its style,â\\x80\\x9d the tutor ran on, delivering himself up to\\nhis fancy. â\\x80\\x9cNot Miltonian, to be sure; more like Macaulay--fine vigorous\\nEnglish, not destitute of appropriate ornament; but still prose, plain\\nprose, Miss Frankland--only prose!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appears to me that you are cross, Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, with a\\nlittle spite; for her young vassal showed signs of enfranchisement when\\nhe called her by her name. â\\x80\\x9cYou like your rainy loch better than\\nanything else in the world; and you are sorry,â\\x80\\x9d said the siren, dropping\\nher voice, â\\x80\\x9cyou are even so unkind as to be sorry that you have come\\nhere?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, suddenly clouding over. â\\x80\\x9cIt is true.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlways,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty; â\\x80\\x9cthough you cannot deny that we freed you from the\\ndelightful duty of listening to Sir Thomas after dinner,â\\x80\\x9d she went on,\\nwith a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cDear old uncle, why does he snore? So you are really\\nsorry you came? I do so wish you would tell me why. Wodensbourne, at\\nleast, is better than Ardmartin,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with a look of pique.\\nShe was rather relieved and yet horribly disappointed at the thought\\nthat Colin might perhaps be coming to his senses, in so far as she\\nherself was concerned. It would save her a good deal of embarrassment,\\nit was true, but she was intent upon preventing it all the same.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI will tell you why I am sorry, if you will tell me why I ought to be\\nglad,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was wise enough, for once, to see that he had the\\nbest of the argument.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty; â\\x80\\x9cif you donâ\\x80\\x99t see yourself--if you donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ncare about the advantages--if you donâ\\x80\\x99t mind living in the same--I mean,\\nif you donâ\\x80\\x99t see the good--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see any good,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with suppressed passion, â\\x80\\x9cexcept one\\nwhich, if I stated it plainly, you would not permit me to name. I see no\\nadvantages that I can venture to put in words. On the other hand,\\nWodensbourne has taught me a great deal. This fine perspicuous English\\nprose points an argument a great deal better than all the Highland\\nrhymings in existence,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, bitterly; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll give you a\\nprofessional example, as Iâ\\x80\\x99m a tutor. At the Holy Loch we conjugate all\\nour verbs affirmatively, interrogatively. Charley and I are getting them\\nup in the negative form here, and itâ\\x80\\x99s hard work,â\\x80\\x9d said Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor.\\nHe broke off with a laugh which sounded strange and harsh, an unusual\\neffect, to his companionâ\\x80\\x99s ear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAffirmatively? Interrogatively?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with a pretty puzzled\\nlook; â\\x80\\x9cI hate long words. How do you suppose I can know what you mean?\\nIt is such a long time since I learnt my verbs--and then one always\\nhated them so. Look here, what a lovely holly-leaf! _Il mâ\\x80\\x99aime, il ne\\nmâ\\x80\\x99aime pas?_â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, pricking her fingers on the verdant\\nspikes and casting a glance at Colin. When their eyes met they both\\nlaughed, and blushed a little in their several ways--that is to say,\\nMiss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s sweet complexion grew a little, a very little, brighter for\\none moment, or Colin at least thought it did; whereas the blood flushed\\nall over his face, and went dancing back like so many streams of new\\nlife and joy to exhilarate his foolish youthful heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the bye, I wonder if that foolish Harry came from my aunt; perhaps\\nshe wants me,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, who had gone as far as she meant to go.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBesides, the fog gets heavier; though, to be sure, I have seen it\\ntwenty times worse at Kilchurn. Perhaps it is the fog and the rain that\\nmakes it poetical there? I prefer reality, if that means a little\\nsunshine, or even the fire in my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s dressing-room,â\\x80\\x9d she cried, with\\na shiver. â\\x80\\x9cGo indoors and write me some pretty verses: it is the only\\nthing you can do after being such a savage. _Au revoir_--there are no\\nhalf-partings in English; and itâ\\x80\\x99s so ridiculous to say good-bye for an\\nhour or two,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty. She made him a little mock curtsey as she\\nwent away, to which, out of the fulness of her grace, the little witch\\nadded a smile and a pretty wave of her hand as she disappeared round the\\ncorner of the great holly, which were meant to leave Colin in a state of\\necstasy. He stayed on the foggy terrace a long time after she had left\\nhim, but the young manâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were not ecstatic. So long as she was\\npresent, so long as the strongest spell of natural magic occupied his\\neyes in watching and his ears in listening to her, he was still carried\\nalong and kept up by the witchery of young love. But in the intervals\\nwhen her presence was withdrawn, matters grew to be rather serious with\\nColin. He was not like a love-sick girl, able to exist upon these\\noccasional sweetnesses; he was a man, and required something more to\\nsatisfy his mind than the tantalizing enchantments and disappointments\\nof this intercourse, which was fascinating enough in its way, but had no\\nsubstance or reality in it. He had spoken truly--it had been entire\\nromance, sweet as a morning dream at the Holy Loch. There the two young\\ncreatures, wandering by the glens and streams, were the ideal youth and\\nmaiden entering upon their natural inheritance of beauty and love and\\nmutual admiration; and at homely Ramore, where the world to which Matty\\nbelonged was utterly unknown, it was not difficult either for Colin\\nhimself, or for those around him; to believe that--with his endowments,\\nhis talents, and genius--he could do anything, or win any woman.\\nWodensbourne was a most sobering, disenchanting reality after this\\nwonderful delusion. The Franklands were all so kind to the young tutor,\\nand their sense of obligation towards him made his position so much\\nbetter than any other tutorâ\\x80\\x99s of his pretensions could have been, that\\nthe lesson came with all the more overwhelming force upon his awakening\\nfaculties. The morning and its dreams were gliding away--or, at least,\\nColin thought so; and this clear daylight, which began to come in,\\ndissipating all the magical effects of sunshine and mist and dew, had to\\nbe faced as he best could. He was not a young prince, independent of\\nordinary requirements; he was truly a poor manâ\\x80\\x99s son, and possessed by\\nan ideal of life and labour such as has inspired many a young Scotchman.\\nHe wanted not only to get on in the world, to acquire an income and\\nmarry Matty, but also to be good for something in his generation. If the\\ncourse of true love had been quite smooth with him, if Matty had been\\nhis natural mate, Colin could not have contented himself with that\\npersonal felicity. He was doubtful of all his surroundings, like most\\nyoung men of his period--doubtful what to do and how to do it--more\\nthan doubtful of all the local ways and fashions of the profession to\\nwhich he had been trained. But underneath this uncertainty lay something\\nof which Colin had no doubt. He had not been brought into the world\\nwithout an object; he did not mean to leave it without leaving some mark\\nthat he had been here. To get through life easily and secure as much\\npleasure as possible by the way was not the theory of existence known at\\nRamore. _There_ it was understood to be a manâ\\x80\\x99s, a sonâ\\x80\\x99s duty to better\\nhis position, to make his way upwards in the world; and this philosophy\\nof life had been enlarged and elevated in the poetic soul of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmother. He had something to do in his own country, in his own\\ngeneration. This was the master-idea of the young manâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\n\\nBut how it was to be reconciled with this aimless, dependent life in the\\nrich English household--with this rivalry, which could never come to\\nanything, with Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s heir--with this vain love, which,\\nit began to be apparent to Colin, must, like the rivalry, end in\\nnothing--it was hard to see. He remained on the terrace for about an\\nhour, walking up and down in the fog. All that he could see before him\\nwere some indistinct outlines of trees, looking black through the\\nsteaming white air, and, behind, the great ghost of the house, with its\\nlong front and wings receding into the mist--the great, wealthy,\\nstranger house, to which he and his life had so little relationship.\\nMany were the thoughts in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind during this hour; and they were\\nfar from satisfactory. Even the object of his love began to be clouded\\nover with fogs, which looked very different, breathing over those low,\\nrich, English levels, from the fairy mists of the Ladyâ\\x80\\x99s Glen. He began\\nto perceive dimly that his devotion was a toy and plaything to this\\nlittle woman of the world. He began to perceive what an amount of love\\nwould be necessary to make such a creature as Matty place herself\\nconsciously by the side of such a man as himself. Love!--and as yet all\\nthat he could say certainly of Matty was that she liked a little\\nlove-making, and had afforded him a great many facilities for that\\nagreeable but unproductive occupation. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart lost itself in an\\nuncertainty darker than the fog. His own position galled him profoundly.\\nHe was Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor. They were all very kind to him; but, supposing\\nhe were to ask the child of the house to descend from her eminence and\\nbe his wife--not even his wife, indeed, but his betrothed; to wait years\\nand years for him until he should be able to claim her--what would\\neverybody think of him? Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat against his breast in loud\\nthrobs of wounded love and pride. At Wodensbourne everything seemed\\nimpossible. He had not the heart to go away and end abruptly his first\\nlove and all his dreams; and how could he stay to consume his heart and\\nhis life? How go back to the old existence, which would now be so much\\nharder? How begin anew and try another life apart from all his training\\nand traditions, for the sake of that wildest of incredible hopes? Colin\\nhad lived for some time in this state of struggle and argument with\\nhimself, and it was only Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s presence which at times delivered him\\nfrom it. Now, as before, he took refuge in the thought that he could not\\nimmediately free himself; that, having accepted his position as\\nCharleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor, he could not relinquish it immediately; that honour\\nbound him to remain for the winter at least. When he had come, for the\\nfiftieth time, to this conclusion, he went indoors, and upstairs to his\\nroom. It was a good way up, but yet it was more luxurious than anything\\nin Ramore, and on the table there were some flowers which she had given\\nhim the night before. Poor Colin! after his serious reflections he owed\\nhimself a little holiday. It was an odd enough conclusion, certainly, to\\nhis thoughts, but he had an hour to himself and his writing-desk was\\nopen on the table, and involuntarily he bethought himself of Miss\\nMattyâ\\x80\\x99s parting words. The end of it was that he occupied his hour\\nwriting and re-writing and polishing into smooth couplets the pretty\\nverses which that young lady had asked for. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s verses were as\\nfollows; from which it will be seen that, though he had a great deal of\\npoetical sentiment, he was right in refusing to consider himself a\\npoet:--\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cIn English speech, my lady said,\\n     There are no sweet half-partings made--\\n     Words half regret, half joy, that tell\\n     We meet again and all is well.\\n     Ah, not for sunny hours or days\\n     Its grave â\\x80\\x98Farewellâ\\x80\\x99 our England says;\\n     Nor for a momentâ\\x80\\x99s absence, true,\\n     Utters its prayer, â\\x80\\x98God be with you.â\\x80\\x99\\n     Other the thoughts that Love may reach,\\n     In the grave tones of English speech;\\n     Deeper than Fancyâ\\x80\\x99s passing breath,\\n     The blessing stands for life or death.\\n     If Heaven in wrath should rule it so,\\n     If earth were capable of woe\\n     So bitter as that this might be\\n     The last dear word â\\x80\\x99twixt thee and me--\\n     Thus Love in English speech, above\\n     All lighter thoughts, breathes: â\\x80\\x98Farewell, Love;\\n     For hours or ages if we part,\\n     God be with thee, whereâ\\x80\\x99er thou art.\\n     To no less hands than His alone\\n     I trust thy soul out of mine own.â\\x80\\x99\\n     Thus speaks the love that, grave and strong\\n     Can master death, neglect, and wrong,\\n     Yet neâ\\x80\\x99er can learn, long as it lives,\\n     To limit the full soul it gives,\\n     Or cheat the parting of its pain\\n     With light words â\\x80\\x99Till we meet again.â\\x80\\x99\\n     Ah, no, while on a momentâ\\x80\\x99s breath\\n     Love holds the poise â\\x80\\x99twixt life and death,\\n     He cannot leave who loves thee, sweet,\\n     With light postponement â\\x80\\x99Till we meet;â\\x80\\x99\\n     But rather prays, â\\x80\\x98Whateâ\\x80\\x99er may be\\n     My life or death, God be with _thee_!\\n     Though one brief hour my course may tell,\\n     Ever and ever Fare _thou_ well.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nProbably the readers of this history will think that Colin deserved his\\nfate.\\n\\nHe gave them to her in the evening, when he found her alone in the\\ndrawing-room--alone, at least, in so far that Lady Frankland was nodding\\nover the newspaper, and taking no notice of Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s proceedings.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thank you; how nice of you!â\\x80\\x9d cried the young lady; but she crumpled\\nthe little billet in her hand, and put it, not into her bosom as young\\nladies do in novels, but into her pocket, glancing at the door as she\\ndid so. â\\x80\\x9cI do believe you are right in saying that there is nothing but\\nprose here,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty. â\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t read it just now. It would only make\\nthem laugh, you know;â\\x80\\x9d and she went away forthwith to the other end of\\nthe room, and began to occupy herself in arranging some music. She was\\nthus employed when Harry came in, looking black enough. Colin was left\\nto himself all that evening. He had, moreover, the gratification of\\nwitnessing all the privileges once accorded to himself given to his\\nrival. Even in matters less urgent than love, it is disenchanting to see\\nthe same attentions lavished on another of which one has imagined oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nself the only possessor. It was in vain that Colin attempted a grim\\nsmile to himself at this transference of Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s wiles and witcheries.\\nThe lively table-talk--more lively than it could be with him, for the\\ntwo knew all each otherâ\\x80\\x99s friends and occupations; the little services\\nabout the tea-table which he himself had so often rendered to Matty, but\\nwhich her cousin could render with a freedom impossible to Colin; the\\npleased, amused looks of the elders, who evidently imagined matters to\\nbe going on as they wished;--would have been enough of themselves to\\ndrive the unfortunate youth half wild as he sat in the background and\\nwitnessed it all. But, as Colinâ\\x80\\x99s evil genius would have it, the curate\\nwas that evening dining at Wodensbourne. And, in pursuance of his\\nbenevolent intention of cultivating and influencing the young Scotchman,\\nthis excellent ecclesiastic devoted himself to Colin. He asked a great\\nmany questions about Scotland and the Sabbath question, and the immoral\\nhabits of the peasantry, to which the catechumen replied with varying\\ntemper, sometimes giving wild answers, quite wide of the mark, as he\\napplied his jealous ear to hear rather the conversation going on at a\\nlittle distance than the interrogatory addressed to himself. Most people\\nhave experienced something of the difficulty of keeping up an\\nindifferent conversation while watching and straining to catch such\\nscraps as may be audible of something more interesting going on close\\nby; but the difficulty was aggravated in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s case by the fact that\\nhis own private interlocutor was doing everything in his power to\\nexasperate him in a well-meaning and friendly way, and that the words\\nwhich fell on his ear close at hand were scarcely less irritating than\\nthe half-heard words, the but too distinctly seen combinations at the\\nother end of the room, where Matty was making tea, with her cousin\\nhanging over her chair. After he had borne it as long as he could, Colin\\nturned to bay.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cScotland is not in the South Seas,â\\x80\\x9d said the young Scotchman; â\\x80\\x9ca dayâ\\x80\\x99s\\njourney any time will take you there. As for our Universities, they are\\nnot rich like yours, but they have been heard of from time to time,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin, with indignation. His eyes had caught fire from long\\nprovocation, and they were fixed at this moment upon Matty, who was\\nshowing her cousin something which she half drew out of her pocket under\\ncover of her handkerchief. Was it his foolish offering that the two were\\nabout to laugh over? In the bitterness of the moment, he could have\\ntaken the most summary vengeance on the irreproachable young clergyman.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe donâ\\x80\\x99t tattoo ourselves now-a-days, and no Englishman has been eaten\\nin my district within the memory of man,â\\x80\\x9d said the young savage, who\\nlooked quite inclined to swallow somebody, though it was doubtful who\\nwas the immediate object of the passion which played in his brown eyes.\\nPerhaps Colin had never been so much excited in his life.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said the wondering curate. â\\x80\\x9cI tire you, I fear--â\\x80\\x9d\\nand he followed Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, after his first movement of offence was\\nover, and perhaps comprehended the mystery, for the curate himself had\\nbeen in his day the subject of experiments. â\\x80\\x9cThey seem to have come to a\\nvery good understanding, these two,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a gentle clerical\\nleaning towards inevitable gossip. â\\x80\\x9cI told you how it was likely to be.\\nI wish you would come to the vicarage oftener,â\\x80\\x9d continued the young\\npriest. â\\x80\\x9cIf Frankland and you donâ\\x80\\x99t get on--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhy should not we get on?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was half mad with\\nexcitement; he had just seen some paper, wonderfully like his own\\nverses, handed from one to another of the pair who were so mutually\\nengrossed--and, if he could have tossed the curate or anybody else who\\nmight happen to be at hand out of window, it would have been a relief to\\nhis feelings. â\\x80\\x9cHe and I are in very different circumstances,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung man, with his eyes aflame. â\\x80\\x9cI am not aware that it is of the least\\nimportance to any one whether we get on or not. You forget that I am\\nonly the tutor.â\\x80\\x9d It occurred to him, as he spoke, that he had said the\\nsame words to Matty at Ardmartin, and how they had laughed together over\\nhis position. It was not any laughing matter now; and to see the two\\nheads bending over that bit of paper was more than he could bear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you would come oftener to the parsonage,â\\x80\\x9d said the benevolent\\ncurate. â\\x80\\x9cI might be--we might be--of--of some use to each other. I am\\nvery much interested in your opinions. I wish I could bring you to see\\nthe beauty of all the Churchâ\\x80\\x99s arrangements and the happiness of\\nthose--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHere Colin rose to his feet without being aware of it, and the curate\\nstopped speaking. He was a man of placid temper himself, and the young\\nstrangerâ\\x80\\x99s aspect alarmed him. Harry Frankland was coming forward with\\nthe bit of paper in his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d said Frankland, instinctively turning his back on the\\ntutor, â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s a little drawing my cousin has been making for some\\nschools you want in the village. She says they must be looked after\\ndirectly. Itâ\\x80\\x99s only a scratch, but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s pretty--a woman is\\nalways shaky in her outlines, you know; but the idea ainâ\\x80\\x99t bad, is it?\\nShe says I am to talk to you on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d said the heir; and he\\nspread out the sketch on the table and began to discuss it with the\\npleased curate. Harry was pleased too, in a modified way; he thought he\\nwas gratifying Matty, and he thought it was good of such a wayward\\nlittle thing to think about the village children; and, finally, he\\nthought if she had been indifferent to the young lord of the manor she\\nwould not have taken so much trouble--which were all agreeable and\\nconsolatory imaginations. As for Colin, standing up by the table, his\\neyes suddenly glowed and melted into a mist of sweet compunctions; he\\nstood quite still for a moment, and then he caught the smallest possible\\ngesture, the movement of a finger, the scarce-perceptible lifting of an\\neyelash, which called him to her side. When he went up to Matty he found\\nher reading very demurely, with her book held in both her hands, and his\\nlittle poem placed above the printed page. â\\x80\\x9cIt is charming!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nlittle witch; â\\x80\\x9cI could not look at it till I had got rid of Harry. It is\\nquite delightful, and it is the greatest shame in the world not to print\\nit; but I canâ\\x80\\x99t conceive how you can possibly remember the trumpery\\nlittle things I say.â\\x80\\x9d The conclusion was, that sweeter dreams than usual\\nvisited Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sleep that night. Miss Matty had not yet done with her\\ninteresting victim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII.\\n\\n\\nColin found a letter on the breakfast-table next morning, which gave a\\nnew development to his mental struggle. It was from the Professor in\\nGlasgow in whose class he had won his greatest laurels. He was not a\\ncorrespondent nor even a friend of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s, and the effect of his letter\\nwas increased accordingly. â\\x80\\x9cOne of our exhibitions to Balliol is to be\\ncompeted for immediately after Christmas,â\\x80\\x9d wrote the Professor. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\nvery anxious that you should be a candidate. From all I have seen of\\nyou, I am inclined to augur a brilliant career for your talents if they\\nare fully cultivated; and for the credit of our University, as well as\\nfor your own sake, I should be glad to see you the holder of this\\nscholarship. Macdonald, your old rival, is a very satisfactory scholar,\\nand has unbounded perseverance and steadiness--doggedness, I might\\nalmost say; but he is not the kind of man--I speak to you frankly--to\\ndo us any credit at Oxford, nor indeed to do himself any\\nparticular advantage. His is the commonly received type of Scotch\\nintelligence--hard, keen, and unsympathetic--a form as little true to\\nthe character of the nation as conventional types usually are. I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nwant, to speak the truth, to send him to my old college as a specimen of\\nwhat we can produce here. It would be much more satisfactory to myself\\nto send you, and I think you could make better use of the opportunities\\nthus opened to you. Lauderdale informs me that Sir Thomas Frankland is\\nan old friend and one under obligations to you or your family: probably,\\nin the circumstances, he would not object to release you from your\\nengagement. The matter is so important, that I donâ\\x80\\x99t think you should\\nallow any false delicacy in respect to your present occupation to deter\\nyou from attending to your own interests. You are now just at the age to\\nbenefit in the highest degree by such an opportunity of prosecuting your\\nstudies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was the letter which woke all the slumbering forces of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind\\nto renew the struggle against his heart and his fancy which he had\\nalready waged unsuccessfully. He was not of much use to Charley for that\\nday at least; their conjugations, negative or affirmative, made but\\nsmall progress, and the sharp-witted boy gave his tutor credit for being\\noccupied with Matty, and scorned him accordingly--of which fact the\\nyoung man was fortunately quite unaware. When it became possible for\\nColin to speak to Sir Thomas on the subject, he had again lost himself\\nin a maze of conflicting inclinations. Should he leave this false\\nposition, and betake himself again, in improved and altered\\ncircumstances, to the business of his life? But Colin saw very clearly\\nthat to leave his present position was to leave Matty--to relinquish his\\nfirst dream; to give up the illusion which, notwithstanding all its\\ndrawbacks, had made life lovely to him for the past year at least.\\nAlready he had so far recovered his senses as to feel that, if he left\\nher now, he left her for ever, and that no new tie could be woven\\nbetween his humble fortunes and those of the little siren of\\nWodensbourne. Knowing this, yet all the while subject to her\\nwitcheries--hearing the song that lured him on--how was he to take a\\nstrenuous resolution, and leap back into the disenchanted existence,\\nfull of duty but deprived of delights, which awaited him in his proper\\nsphere? He had gone out to the terrace again in the afternoon to argue\\nit out with himself, when he encountered Sir Thomas, who had a cold, and\\nwas taking his constitutional discreetly for his healthâ\\x80\\x99s sake, not\\nwithout an eye to the garden in which Lady Frankland intended sundry\\nalterations which were not quite satisfactory to her lord. â\\x80\\x9cOf course I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t mean to interfere with my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s fancies,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet, who\\nwas pleased to find some one to whom he could confide his griefs; â\\x80\\x9ca\\nflower-garden is a womanâ\\x80\\x99s department, certainly, if anything is; but I\\nwonâ\\x80\\x99t have this terrace disturbed. It used to be my motherâ\\x80\\x99s favourite\\nwalk,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas. The good man went on, a little moved by this\\nparticular recollection, meditating his grievance. Sir Thomas had got\\nvery nearly to the other end of that table-land of existence which lies\\nbetween the ascent and the descent--that interval in which the suns burn\\nhottest, the winds blow coldest, but upon which, when it is fair\\nweather, the best part of life may be spent. By right of his extended\\nprospect, he was naturally a little contemptuous of those griefs and\\nstruggles of youth which cloud over the ascending way. Had any one told\\nhim of the real conflict which was going on in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind, the\\nexcellent middle-aged man would but have laughed at the boyâ\\x80\\x99s folly--a\\nlaughter softened yet confirmed by the recollection of similar clouds in\\nhis own experience which had long dispersed into thin air. He was a\\nlittle serious at the present moment, about my ladyâ\\x80\\x99s caprice, which\\naimed at altering the smooth stretch of lawn to which his eyes had been\\naccustomed for years--and turned to listen to Colin, when the young man\\naddressed him, with a slight air of impatience, not knowing anything of\\nimportance which the youth could have to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should be glad to know,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with hesitation, â\\x80\\x9chow long you\\nthink Charley will want my services. Lady Frankland was speaking the\\nother day of the improvement in his health--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet, brightening up a little, for his invalid boy\\nwas his favourite. â\\x80\\x9cWe are greatly obliged to you, Campbell. Charley has\\nbrightened and improved amazingly since you came here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was an embarrassing way of receiving Colinâ\\x80\\x99s attempt at disengaging\\nhimself from Charley. The youth hesitated and stammered, and could not\\nwell make up his mind what to say next. In his perplexity he took out\\nthe letter which had stimulated him to this attempt. Sir Thomas, who was\\nstill a little impatient, took it out of his hands and read it. The\\nbaronet whistled under his breath with puzzled astonishment as he read.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas. â\\x80\\x9cYou declined to go to Oxford\\nunder my auspices, and now here is something about a scholarship and a\\ncompetition. You want to go to the University after all--but why then\\nreject my proposal when I made it?â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s patron, who thought his\\n_protÃ©gÃ©_ had chosen a most unlucky moment for changing his mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cbut I could not accept your offer at\\nany time. I could not accept such a favour from any man; and I know no\\nclaim I have upon you to warrant--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, stuff!â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas; â\\x80\\x9cI know very well what are the obligations\\nI am under to you, Campbell. You saved my son Harryâ\\x80\\x99s life--we are all\\nvery sensible of your claims. I should certainly have expected you to\\nhelp Harry as far as was possible--for he is like myself--he is more in\\nthe way of cricket and boating, and a day with the hounds when he can\\nget it, than Greek; but I should have felt real pleasure,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nbaronet blandly, â\\x80\\x9cin helping so deserving a young man, and one to whom\\nwe all feel so much indebted--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThank you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who at that moment would have felt real\\npleasure in punching the head, or maltreating the person of the heir of\\nWodensbourne--â\\x80\\x9cI suppose we have all some pride in one way or another. I\\nam obliged to you, Sir Thomas, but I could not accept such a favour from\\nyou; whereas, a prize won at my own university,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man,\\nwith a little elevation, â\\x80\\x9cis no discredit, but--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDiscredit!â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas; â\\x80\\x9cyou must have a very strange idea of me,\\nMr. Campbell, if you imagine it discreditable to accept a kindness at my\\nhands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d again said Colin, who was at his witâ\\x80\\x99s end; â\\x80\\x9cI did\\nnot mean to say anything uncivil; but I am Scotch. I dislike receiving\\nfavours. I prefer--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSir Thomas rubbed his hands. The apology of nationality went a long way\\nwith him, and restored his temper. â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes; I understand,â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nwith good-humoured superiority: â\\x80\\x9cyou prefer conferring favours--you like\\nto keep the upper hand. I know a great deal of you Scotchmen; I flatter\\nmyself I understand your national character. I should like to know now,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the baronet, confidentially, â\\x80\\x9cif you are set upon becoming a Scotch\\nminister, as you once told me, what good it will do you going to Oxford?\\nSupposing you were to distinguish yourself, which I think very possible;\\nsupposing you were to take a--a second-class, or even a first-class, for\\nexample, what would be the good? The reputation and the--the _prestige_\\nand that sort of thing would be altogether lost in Scotland. All the\\nupper classes you know have gone from the old Kirk, and you would not\\nplease the peasants a bit better for that--indeed, the idea of an Oxford\\nfirst-class man spending his life preaching to a set of peasants is\\nabsurd,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas. â\\x80\\x9cI know more about Scotland than most men: I\\npaid a great deal of attention to that Kirk question. If you go to\\nOxford I shall expect you to change your mind about your profession. If\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t take to something more ambitious, at least youâ\\x80\\x99ll go in for\\nthe Church.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have always intended so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with his grand air, ignoring\\nthe baronetâ\\x80\\x99s meaning. â\\x80\\x9cTo preach, if it is only to peasants, is more\\nworth a manâ\\x80\\x99s while than leading prayers for ever, like your curate\\nhere. I am only Scotch; I know no better,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWe want changes\\nin Scotland, it is true; but it is as good to work for Scotland as for\\nEngland--better for me--and I should not grudge my first-class to the\\nservice of my native Church,â\\x80\\x9d said the youth, with a movement of his\\nhead which tossed his heavy brown locks from his concealed forehead. Sir\\nThomas looked at him with a blank amazement, not knowing in the least\\nwhat he meant. He thought the young fellow had been piqued somehow, most\\nprobably by Matty, and was in a heroical mood, which mood Colinâ\\x80\\x99s patron\\ndid not pretend to understand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with some impatience, â\\x80\\x9cI suppose you will take\\nyour own way; but I must say it would seem very odd to see an Oxford\\nfirst-class man in a queer little kirk in the Highlands, preaching a\\nsermon an hour long. Of course, if you like it, thatâ\\x80\\x99s another matter;\\nand the Scotch certainly do seem to like preaching,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas,\\nwith natural wonder; â\\x80\\x9cbut we flattered ourselves you were comfortable\\nhere. I am sorry you want to go away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis was taking Colin on his undefended side. The words brought colour\\nto his cheeks and moisture to his eye. â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to go\\naway,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and paused, and faltered, and grew still more deeply\\ncrimson. â\\x80\\x9cI can never forget; I can never think otherwise than\\nwith--with gratitude of Wodensbourne.â\\x80\\x9d He was going to have said\\ntenderness, but stopped himself in time; and even Sir Thomas, though his\\neyes were noway anointed with any special chrism of insight, saw the\\nemotion in his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen donâ\\x80\\x99t go,â\\x80\\x9d said the straightforward baronet; â\\x80\\x9cwhy should you go if\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t want to? We are all most anxious that you should stay. Indeed,\\nit would upset my plans dreadfully if you were to leave Charley at\\npresent. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful fellow, is Charley. He has twice as much\\nbrains as the rest of my boys, sir; and you understand him, Campbell. He\\nis happier, he is stronger, he is even a better fellow--poor lad, when\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s ill he canâ\\x80\\x99t be blamed for a bit of temper--since you came. Indeed,\\nnow I think it over,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas, â\\x80\\x9cyou will mortify and disappoint\\nme very much if you go away. I quite considered you had accepted\\nCharleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutorship for a year at least. My dear, hereâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty\\nbusiness,â\\x80\\x9d he said, turning round at the sound of steps and voices,\\nwhich Colin had already discerned from afar with a feeling that he was\\nnow finally vanquished, and could yield with a good grace; â\\x80\\x9chereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nCampbell threatening to go away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo go away!â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cDear me, he canâ\\x80\\x99t mean it. Why, he\\nonly came the other day; and Charley, you knowâ\\x80\\x9d--said the anxious\\nmother; but she recollected Harryâ\\x80\\x99s objection to the tutor, and did not\\nmake any very warm opposition. Colin, however, was totally unconscious\\nof the lukewarmness of the lady of the house. The little scream of\\ndismay with which Miss Matty received the intelligence might have\\ndeluded a wiser man than he.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGoing away! I call it downright treachery,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty. â\\x80\\x9cI think\\nit is using you very unkindly, uncle; when he knows you put such\\ndependence on him about Charley; and when _we_ know the house has been\\nquite a different thing since Mr. Campbell came,â\\x80\\x9d said the little witch,\\nwith a double meaning, of which Colin, poor boy, swallowed the sweeter\\nsense, without a momentâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation. _He_ knew it was not the\\nimprovement in Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s temper which had made the house different to\\nMatty; but Lady Frankland, who was not a woman of imagination, took up\\nseriously what seemed to be the obvious meaning of the words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is quite true. I am sure we are much obliged to Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid; â\\x80\\x9cCharley is quite an altered boy; and I had hoped, you were liking\\nWodensbourne. If we could do anything to make it more agreeable to you,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lady Frankland, graciously, remembering how Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ctemperâ\\x80\\x9d was\\nthe horror of the house. â\\x80\\x9cI am sure Sir Thomas would not grudge--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray do not say any more,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, confused and blushing; â\\x80\\x9cno house\\ncould be more--no house could be _so_ agreeable to me. You are all very\\nkind. It was only my--my own--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat he was going to say is beyond the reach of discovery. He was\\ninterrupted by a simultaneous utterance from all the three persons\\npresent, of which Colin heard only the soft tones of Matty. â\\x80\\x9cHe does not\\nmean it,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9che only means to alarm us. I shall not say\\ngood-bye, nor farewell either. You shall have no good wishes if you\\n_think_ of going away. False as a Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said the siren under her\\nbreath, with a look which overpowered Colin. He never was quite sure\\nwhat words followed from the elder people; but even Lady Frankland\\nbecame fervent when she recalled what Charley had been before the advent\\nof the tutor. â\\x80\\x9cWhat we should do with him now, if Mr. Campbell was to\\nleave and the house full of people, I tremble to think,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nalarmed mother. When Colin returned to the house it was with a slightly\\nflattered sense of his own value and importance new to him--with a\\nsense too that duty had fully acquitted and justified inclination, and\\nthat he could not at the present moment leave his post. This delicious\\nunction he laid to his soul while it was still thrilling with the glance\\nand with the words which Matty, in her alarm, had used to prevent her\\nslaveâ\\x80\\x99s escape. Whatever happened, he could not, he would not, go;\\nbetter to perish with such a hope, than to thrive without it; and, after\\nall, there was no need for perishing, and next year Oxford might still\\nbe practicable. So Colin said to himself, as he made his simple toilette\\nfor the evening, with a face which was radiant with secret sunshine, â\\x80\\x9cIt\\nwas only my--my own--.â\\x80\\x9d How had he intended to complete that sentence\\nwhich the Franklands took out of his mouth? Was he going to say\\ninterest, advantage, peace? The unfinished words came to his mind\\ninvoluntarily when he was alone. They kept flitting in and out,\\ndisturbing him with vague touches of uneasiness, asking to be completed.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy own--only my own,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said to himself as he went downstairs. He\\nwas saying over the words softly as he came to a landing, upon which\\nthere was a great blank staircase-window reaching down to the floor, and\\ndarkly filled at this present moment with a grey waste of sky and\\ntumbling clouds, with a wild wind visibly surging through the vacant\\natmosphere, and conveying almost to the eye in palpable vision the same\\ndemonstration of its presence as it did to the ear. â\\x80\\x9cMy own--only my\\nown. I wonder what you mean; the words sound quite sentimental,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMiss Matty, suddenly appearing at Colinâ\\x80\\x99s side, with a light in her\\nhand. The young man was moved strangely; he could not tell why. â\\x80\\x9cI meant\\nmy own life, I believe,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a sudden impulse, unawares; â\\x80\\x9conly\\nmy own life,â\\x80\\x9d and went down the next flight of stairs before the young\\nlady, not knowing what he was about. When he came to himself, and stood\\nback, blushing with hot shame, to let her pass, the words came back in a\\ndreary whirl, as if the wind had taken them up and tossed them at him,\\nbut of that wild windowful of night. His life--only his life; was that\\nwhat he had put in comparison with Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s temper and Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s vanity,\\nand given up with enthusiasm? Something chill, like a sudden cold\\ncurrent through his veins, ran to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart for a moment. Next\\nminute he was in the room, where bright lights, and lively talk, and all\\nthe superficial cordiality of prosperity and good-humour filled the\\natmosphere round him. Whatever the stake had been, the cast was over and\\nthe decision made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII.\\n\\n\\nThe Christmas guests began to arrive at Wodensbourne on the same day\\nthat Colin concluded this sacrifice; and for some days the tutor had\\nscant measure of that society which had lured him to the relinquishment\\neven of his â\\x80\\x9clife.â\\x80\\x9d When the house was full of people, Matty found a\\nthousand occupations in which of necessity Colin had no share,--not to\\nsay that the young lady felt it a matter of prudence, after she had\\naccepted his sacrifice, to be as little as possible in his society. It\\nwas pleasant enough to feel her power, and to know that for her\\ninvaluable smile the boy had bartered his independent career; but to put\\nhim in the way of claiming any reward for his offering would have been\\nexceedingly inconvenient to Matty. He paid the full penalty accordingly\\nfor at least a week thereafter, and had abundant opportunity of counting\\nthe cost and seeing what he had done. It was not exhilarating to spend\\nthe mornings with Charley, to answer his sharp questions, to satisfy his\\nacute but superficial mind--in which curiosity was everything, and\\nthought scarcely existed--and to feel that for this he had given up all\\nthat was individual in his life. He had left his own University, he had\\ngiven up the chance of going to Oxford, he had separated himself from\\nhis companions and given up his occupations--all for the pleasure of\\nteaching Charley, of standing in a corner of the Wodensbourne\\ndrawing-room, and feeling acutely through every fibre of his sensitive\\nScotch frame that he was the tutor, and stood accordingly in about as\\nmuch relationship to the society in which he found himself as if he had\\nbeen a New Zealand chief. Colin, however, had made up his mind, and\\nthere was nothing for it now but to consent and accept his fate. But it\\nwas astonishing how different things looked from that corner of the\\ndrawing-room--unspeakably different from the aspect they bore when Colin\\nhimself was the only stranger present, and even different from the state\\nof affairs after Harry came home, when he had been thrown into the\\nshade, and a fever of excitement and jealousy had taken possession of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s breast. He was very young, and was not used to society. When\\nMatty addressed to her cousin the same witcheries which she had expended\\non her worshipper, the young man was profoundly wretched and jealous\\nbeyond description. But when he saw her use the same wiles with others,\\nlavishing freely the smiles which had been so precious to his deluded\\nfancy upon one and another, a painful wonder seized the mind of Colin.\\nTo stand in that corner possessed by one object was to be behind the\\nscenes. Colin was mortal; he had made a great sacrifice, and he was glad\\nto have made it; but he could not forget it, nor stand at his ease,\\naccepting the civilities that might be offered to him as to another. At\\nfirst he expected the equivalent which he imagined had been pledged to\\nhim, and when he found out his mistake in that, he discovered also how\\nimpossible it was to refrain from a feeling of injury, a jealous\\nconsciousness of inadequate appreciation. He himself knew, if nobody\\nelse did, the price at which he had bought those siren smiles, and under\\nthese circumstances to stand by and see them bestowed upon others, was\\nan experience which conveyed wonderful insight to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s inexperienced\\neyes. If Miss Matty saw him at all, she saw him in the corner, and gave\\nhim a nod and a smile in passing, which she thought quite enough to keep\\nhim happy for the time being. For, unluckily, the professors of this art\\nof fascination, both male and female, are apt now and then to deceive\\nthemselves as to the extent of their own powers. While Matty was so\\nperfectly easy in her mind about the tall figure in the corner, he, for\\nhis part, was watching her with feelings which it would be very hard to\\ndescribe. His very admiration, the sincerity of his love, intensified\\nthe smouldering germs of disappointment and disgust of which he became\\nuneasily conscious as he stood and watched. He saw by glimpses â\\x80\\x9cthe very\\nheart of the machineâ\\x80\\x9d from that unnoticed observatory. He saw how she\\ndistributed and divided her bright looks, her playful talk; he perceived\\nhow she exerted herself to be more and more charming if any victim\\nproved refractory, and was slow to yield. Had Colin been kept more\\nperfectly in hand himself, had she devoted a little more time, a little\\nmore pains to him, it is probable that the sweet flattery would have\\nprevailed, and that he might have forgiven her the too great readiness\\nshe showed to please others. But, as it was, the glamour died out of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes ray by ray, and bitter in the consciousness of all he had\\nsacrificed, he began to find out how little the reward, even could he\\nhave obtained it, was worth the price. The process was slow, but it went\\non night by night--and night by night, as the disenchantment progressed,\\nColin became more and more unhappy. It was wretchedto see the sweet\\nillusion which had made life so beautiful disappearing under his very\\neyes, and to feel that the enchantment, which had to him been so\\nirresistible, was a conscious and studied art, which could be used just\\nwhen the possessor pleased, with as much coolness as if it had bean the\\nart of embroidery or any other feminine handicraft. A wise spectator\\nmight, and probably would, have said, that to learn this lesson was the\\nbest thing possible for Colin; but that did not make it the less cruel,\\nthe less bitter. In his corner the young man gradually drew nearer and\\nnearer to the fierce misanthropy of outraged youth, that misanthropy\\nwhich is as warm a protest against common worldliness as the first\\nenthusiasm. But his heart was not yet released, though his eyes were\\nbecoming enlightened; reason works slowly against love--and bitter at\\nthe bottom of all lay the sense of the sacrifice, which was only his\\nlife.\\n\\nA few days after Christmas, a party of the young men staying at\\nWodensbourne were bound upon a boating expedition, to decide some bet\\nwhich bore remotely upon one of the greatest events of the University\\nyear--the great match between Oxford and Cambridge. Harry Frankland, who\\nwas an Oxford man, though the spires of Cambridge might almost have been\\nvisible from his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s park, had there been any eminence high enough\\nto afford a view, was deeply interested on the side of his own\\nUniversity; and some unfortunate youths belated at Cambridge during the\\nholidays for want of friends, or money, or some other needful adjunct of\\nfestival-keeping, were but too glad to seize the opportunity of a dayâ\\x80\\x99s\\npleasure. Colin never knew how it was that he came to be asked to join\\nthe party. Though Harryâ\\x80\\x99s jealousy was gone, for the moment at least,\\nthere was not even a pretence of friendship between the tutor and the\\nheir. Nor could Colin ever explain how it was that he consented to go,\\nfor scores of objections naturally presented themselves at the first\\nproposal. He was sensitive, affronted, feeling deeply his false\\nposition, and ready to receive with suspicion any overtures of\\nfriendliness from any man possessed by a benevolent wish to be kind to\\nthe tutor. It was, however, his fate to go, and the preliminaries\\narranged themselves somehow. They started on a frosty bright morning,\\nwhen the trees of the park were still only emerging from mists tinted\\nred by the sunshine, a joyous, rather noisy party; they were to walk to\\nthe river, which was about six miles off, and when their business was\\ndecided, to lunch at a favourite haunt of the Cambridge undergraduates.\\nLady Frankland, who did not much approve of the expedition, gave them\\nmany counsels about the way. â\\x80\\x9cI wish you would drive and get back by\\ndaylight,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cotherwise I know you will be taking _that_ path\\nacross the fields.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat path?â\\x80\\x9d said some one present; â\\x80\\x9cif there is one specially\\nobjectionable we will be sure to take it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would not if I were you,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty. â\\x80\\x9cThere is a nasty canal in\\nthe way; if you pass it after dark, some of you will certainly fall in.\\nIt would be a pity to be drowned in such a slimy, shabby way. Much\\nbetter have all sorts of dog-carts and things, and drive back in time\\nfor a cup of tea.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which speech there was a general laugh. â\\x80\\x9cMatty would give her soul\\nfor a cup of tea,â\\x80\\x9d said her cousin. â\\x80\\x9cWhat a precious fright youâ\\x80\\x99ll all\\nbe in if weâ\\x80\\x99re late for dinner. I ought to know all about the canal by\\nthis time. Come along. Itâ\\x80\\x99s too cold to think of drowning,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry\\nFrankland, with a filial nod of leave-taking to his mother. As for\\nMatty, she went to the door with them to see them go off, as did some\\nothers of the ladies. Matty lifted her pretty cheek sideways and\\nstretched out her hand into the frosty atmosphere as if to feel for\\nrain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI thought I saw some drops,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cit would be frightful if it\\ncame on to rain now, and spoiled our chances of skating. Good morning,\\nand, whatever you do, I beg of you donâ\\x80\\x99t get drowned in the canal. It\\nwould be such a shabby way of making an end of oneâ\\x80\\x99s self,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty.\\nWhen she looked up she caught Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eye, who was the last to leave the\\nhouse. She was in the humour to be kind to him at that moment. â\\x80\\x9cShall I\\nsay good-bye, or farewell?â\\x80\\x9d she said softly, with that confidential air\\nwhich Colin, notwithstanding his new enlightenment, had no heart to\\nresist.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shall say what you please,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, lingering on the step\\nbeside her. The young man was in a kind of desperate mood. Perhaps he\\nliked to show his companions that he too could have his turn.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye--farewell,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, â\\x80\\x9cbut then that implies shaking hands,â\\x80\\x9d\\nand she gave him her pretty hand with a little laugh, making it appear\\nto the group outside that the clownish tutor had insisted upon that\\nunnecessary ceremony. â\\x80\\x9cBut whatever you please to say, I like _au\\nrevoir_ best,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty; â\\x80\\x9cit does not even suggest parting.â\\x80\\x9d And\\nshe waved her hand as she turned away. â\\x80\\x9cTill we meet again,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nlittle enchantress. It might be to him especially, or it might be to\\nall, that she made this little gesture of farewell. Anyhow, Colin\\nfollowed the others with indescribable sensations. He no longer believed\\nin her, but her presence, her looks, her words, had still mastery over\\nhim. Ha had walked half the way before the fumes of that leave-taking\\nhad gone out of his brain; though most part of the time he was keeping\\nup a conversation about things in general with the stupidest of the\\nparty, who kept pertinaciously by the tutorâ\\x80\\x99s side.\\n\\nThe day went off with considerable satisfaction to all the party, and,\\nas Colin and Frankland did not come much in contact, there was little\\nopportunity for displaying the spirit of opposition and contradiction\\nwhich existed between them. Fortunately, Colin was not at hand to hear\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s strictures upon his method of handling the oars, nor did\\nFrankland perceive the smile of contemptuous recollection which came\\nupon the tutorâ\\x80\\x99s face as he observed how tenderly the heir of\\nWodensbourne stepped into the boat, keeping clear of the wet as of old.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat fellow has not a bit of science,â\\x80\\x9d said young Frankland; â\\x80\\x9che\\nexpects mere strength to do everything. Look how he holds his oar. It\\nnever occurs to him that he is in anything lighter than a Highland\\nfishing cobble. What on earth, I wonder, made us bring him here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cScience goes a great way,â\\x80\\x9d said the most skilled oarsman of the party,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to have the training of Campbell all the same. He talks of\\ngoing to Balliol, and I shall write to Cox about him. What a chest the\\nfellow has,â\\x80\\x9d said the admiring spectator. Meanwhile Colin had not\\nhesitated to explain his smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI smile because I recollect smiling years ago,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cSee how\\nFrankland steps into the boat. When he was a boy he did the same. I\\nremember it, and it amused me; for wet feet were a new idea to me in\\nthose days;â\\x80\\x9d and Colin laughed outright, and the eyes of the two met.\\nNeither knew what the other had been saying, but the spectators\\nperceived without more words that the young men were not perfectly safe\\ncompanions for each other, and took precautions, with instinctive\\ncomprehension of the case.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThose two donâ\\x80\\x99t get on,â\\x80\\x9d said one of the party, under his breath. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\n_is_ hard upon a fellow, you know, to have another fellow stuck up at\\nhis side who saved his life, and that sort of thing. I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t like it\\nmyself. Somebody keep an eye on Frankland--and on the Scotch fellow,\\ntoo,â\\x80\\x9d said the impartial peace-maker. Luckily, neither of the two who\\nwere thus put under friendly surveillance was at all aware of the fact,\\nand Colin submitted with as good a grace as possible to the constant\\ncompanionship of the stupidest and best-humoured of the party, who had\\nalready bestowed his attentions and society upon the tutor. This state\\nof things, however, did not endure after the luncheon, at which it was\\nnot possible for Colin to remain a merely humble spectator and sharer of\\nthe young menâ\\x80\\x99s entertainment. He had not been broken in to such duty;\\nand, excited by exercise and the freedom round him, Colin could no more\\nhelp talking than he could help the subsequent discovery made by his\\ncompanions that â\\x80\\x9cthe Scotch fellowâ\\x80\\x9d was very good company. The young men\\nspent--as was to be expected--a much longer time over their lunch than\\nwas at all necessary; and the short winter day was just over when they\\nset out on their way home through the evening mists, which soon deepened\\ninto darkness, very faintly lighted by a few doubtful stars. Everybody\\ndeclared, it is true, that there was to be a moon; indeed, it was with\\nthe distinct understanding that there was to be a moon that the party\\nhad started on foot from Wodensbourne. But the moon showed herself\\nlamentably indifferent to the arrangements which depended on her. She\\ngave not the least sign of appearing anywhere in that vast, windy vault\\nof sky, which indeed had a little light in itself, but could spare\\nscarcely any to show the wayfarers where they were going through the\\ndreary wintry road and between the rustling leafless hedges. When they\\ngot into the fields matters grew rather worse. It was hard to keep the\\npath, harder still to find the stiles and steer through gaps and\\nditches. The high road made a round which would lead them three or four\\nmiles out of their way, and Frankland insisted upon his own perfect\\nknowledge of the by-way by which they could reach Wodensbourne in an\\nhour. â\\x80\\x9cMind the canal we were warned of this morning,â\\x80\\x9d suggested one of\\nthe party, as they paused in the dark at the corner of a black field to\\ndecide which way they should go. â\\x80\\x9cOh, confound the canal; as if I didnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nknow every step of the way,â\\x80\\x9d said young Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a settled\\nprinciple in the female mind that one is bent upon walking into canals\\nwhenever one has an opportunity. Come along; if youâ\\x80\\x99re afraid, perhaps\\nCampbell will show you the other way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, without the least hesitation. â\\x80\\x9cI have no wish\\nto walk into the canal, for my part;â\\x80\\x9d upon which there was a universal\\nprotest against parting company. â\\x80\\x9cCome along,â\\x80\\x9d said one, who thrust his\\narm through Colinâ\\x80\\x99s as he spoke, but who was no longer the stupid member\\nof the party, â\\x80\\x9cweâ\\x80\\x99ll all take our chance together;â\\x80\\x9d but he kept the\\ntutor as far as possible from the heir of Wodensbourne. â\\x80\\x9cFrankland and\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t seem to get on,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s companion; â\\x80\\x9cyet heâ\\x80\\x99s a very nice\\nfellow when you come to know him. I suppose you most have had some\\nmisunderstanding, eh? Wasnâ\\x80\\x99t it you who saved his life?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI never saved any oneâ\\x80\\x99s life,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, a little sharply; â\\x80\\x9cand we\\nget on well enough--as well as is necessary. We have no call to see much\\nof each other.â\\x80\\x9d After this they all went on through the dark as well as\\nthey could, getting into difficulties now and then, sometimes collecting\\ntogether in a bewildered group at a stile or turning, and afterwards\\nstreaming on in single file--a succession of black figures which it was\\nimpossible to identify except by their voices. Certainly they made noise\\nenough. What with shouts from the beginning to the end of the file, what\\nwith bursts of song which came occasionally from one or another or were\\ntaken up in uproarious chorus, the profound stillness which enveloped\\nand surrounded them was compelled to own their human presence to the ear\\nat least. In the natural course of their progress Colin and his\\nimmediate companion had got nearly to the front, when the laughter and\\nnoise was suddenly interrupted. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t quite see where we are going,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Harry. â\\x80\\x9cStop a bit; I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t mind going on myself, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nwant to risk you fellows who are frightened for canals. Look here; the\\nroad ought to have gone on at this corner, but hereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing but a\\nhedge. Keep where you are till I look out. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s a light over there,\\nbut I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell whatâ\\x80\\x99s between.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps itâ\\x80\\x99s the canal,â\\x80\\x9d said some one behind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, of course itâ\\x80\\x99s the canal,â\\x80\\x9d said Frankland, with irritation.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou stand back till I try; if I fall in, itâ\\x80\\x99s my own fault, which will\\nbe a consolation to my friends,â\\x80\\x9d cried the angry guide. He started\\nforward impatiently, not, however, without being closely followed by two\\nor three, among whom was Colin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be foolish, Frankland,â\\x80\\x9d said one voice in the darkness; â\\x80\\x9clet us\\nall go together--let us be cautious. I feel something like gravel under\\nmy feet. Steady, steady; feel with your foot before you put it down. Oh!\\ngood heavens, what is it?â\\x80\\x9d The voice broke off abruptly; a loud splash\\nand a cry ensued, and the young men behind saw the figures in advance of\\nthem suddenly drop and disappear. It _was_ the canal, upon which they\\nhad been making unawares. Two out of the four had only stumbled on the\\nbank, and rose up again immediately; and as those behind, afraid to\\npress forward, not knowing what to do, stood watching appalled, another\\nand another figure scrambled up with difficulty, calling for help, out\\nof the water, into which they had not, however, plunged deeply enough\\nto peril their lives. Then there was a terrible momentary pause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAre we all here?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. His voice sounded like a funeral bell\\npealing through the darkness. Hehe knew they were not all there. He,\\nwith his keen eyes, rendered keener by opposition and enmity, had seen\\nbeyond mistake that the first of all went down and had not risen again.\\nThe consciousness made his voice tragic as it rang through the darkness.\\nSomebody shouted, â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, thank God!â\\x80\\x9d in reply. It was only a second,\\nbut years of life rolled up upon Colin in that moment of time--years of\\nsweet troublous existence behind; years of fair life before. Should he\\nlet him die? It was not his fault; nobody could blame him. And what\\nright had _he_ to risk his life a second time for Harry Frankland? All\\nthat a murderer, all that a martyr could feel rushed through Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmind in that instant of horrible indecision. Then somebody said,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrankland, Frankland! where is Frankland?â\\x80\\x9d That voice was the touch of\\nfate. With a strange shout, of which he was unconscious, Colin plunged\\ninto the black invisible stream. By this time the others of the party\\nsaw with unspeakable relief lights approaching, and heard through the\\ndarkness voices of men coming to their assistance. They were close by\\none of the locks of the canal; and it was the keeper of it, not unused\\nto such accidents, who came hurrying to give what help was possible. His\\nlantern and some torches which the anxious young men managed to light\\nthrew a wild illumination over the muddy, motionless stream, in which\\ntwo of their number, lately as gay and light-hearted as any, were now\\nstruggling for their life. The same light flared horribly over the two\\nmotionless figures, which, after an interval which seemed like years to\\nthe bystanders, were at length brought out of the blackness; one of them\\nstill retaining strength and consciousness to drag the other with him up\\nthe stony margin before his senses failed. They lay silent both, with\\npallid faces, upon the hard path; one as like death as the other, with a\\nkind of stony, ghostly resemblance in their white insensibility, except\\nthat there was blood on the lips of one, who must have struck, the\\nlockman said, upon some part of the lock. They were carried into the\\ncottage, and hurried messengers sent to the nearest doctor and to\\nWodensbourne. Meanwhile the two lay together, pallid and motionless,\\nnobody knowing which was living and which dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX.\\n\\n\\nColin never ascertained what were the events immediately succeeding his\\nplunge into the canal; all he could recall dimly of that strange crisis\\nin his life was a sense of slow motion in which he himself was passive,\\nand of looking up at the stars in a dark-blue, frosty, winterly sky,\\nwith a vague wonder in his mind how it was that he saw them so clearly,\\nand whether it was they or he that moved. Afterwards, when his mind\\nbecame clear, it grew apparent to him that he must have opened his eyes\\nfor a moment while he was being carried home; but there intervened a\\nperiod during which he heard nothing distinctly, and in which the only\\nclear point to him was this gleam of starlight, and the accompanying\\nsense of motion, which perplexed his faculties in his weakness. While he\\nlay feverish and unconscious he kept repeating, to the amazement of the\\nbystanders, two stray lines which had no apparent connexion with any of\\nthe circumstances surrounding him.\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cEach with its little span of sky,\\n     And little lot of stars,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\npoor Colin said to himself over and over, without knowing it. It had\\nbeen only for a moment that he opened his eyes out of the torpor which\\nwas all but death, but that moment was enough to colour all the\\nwanderings of his mind while still the weakness of the body dominated\\nand overpowered it. Like a picture or a dream, he kept in his\\nrecollection the sharp frosty glimmer, the cold twinkling of those\\npassionless, distant lights, and with it a sense of rushing air and\\nuniversal chill, and a sound and consciousness of wending his way\\nbetween rustling hedges, though all the while he was immovable. That\\nfeeling remained with him till he woke from a long sleep one afternoon\\nwhen the twilight was setting in, and found himself in a room which was\\nnot his own room, lying in a great bed hung with crimson curtains, which\\nwere made still more crimson by a ruddy glow of fire-light which flashed\\nreflections out of the great mirror opposite the end of the bed. Colin\\nlay a while in a pause of wonder and confusion when he woke. The\\nstarlight went out of his eyes and the chill out of his frame, and a\\ncertain sense of languid comfort came over him. When he said, â\\x80\\x9cWhere am\\nI?â\\x80\\x9d faintly, in a voice which he could scarcely recognise for his own,\\ntwo women rose hastily and approached him. One of these was Lady\\nFrankland, the other a nurse. While the attendant hurried forward to see\\nif he wanted anything, Lady Frankland took his hand and pressed it\\nwarmly in both hers.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou shall hear all about it to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with the tears in her\\neyes; â\\x80\\x9cyou will do well now, but you must not exert yourself to-night.\\nWe have all been so anxious about you. Hush, hush! You must take this;\\nyou must not ask any more questions to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat he had to take was some warm jelly, of which he swallowed a little,\\nwith wonder and difficulty. He did not understand what had befallen him,\\nor how he had been reduced to this invalid condition. â\\x80\\x9cHush, hush! you\\nmust not ask any questions to-night,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland; and she went\\nto the door as if to leave the room, and then came back again and bent\\nover Colin and kissed his forehead, with her eyes shining through tears.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGod bless you and reward you!â\\x80\\x9d she said, smiling and crying over him;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou will do well now--you have a motherâ\\x80\\x99s blessing and a motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nprayers,â\\x80\\x9d and with these strange words she went away hastily, as if not\\ntrusting herself to say more.\\n\\nColin lay back on his pillow with his mind full of wonder, and, catching\\nat the clue she had given him, made desperate feeble efforts to piece it\\nout, and get back again into his life. He found it so hard fighting\\nthrough that moment of starlight which still haunted him, that he had to\\ngo to sleep upon it, but by-and-by woke up again when all was\\nsilent--when the light was shaded, and the nurse reclining in an easy\\nchair, and everything betokened night--and lying awake for an hour or\\ntwo, at last began to gather himself up, and recollect what had\\nhappened. He had almost leaped from his bed when he recalled the scene\\nby the canal--his conviction that Frankland had gone down, his own\\ndesperate plunge. But Colin was past leaping from his bed, for that time\\nat least. He followed out this recollection, painfully trying to think\\nwhat had occurred. Was Harry Frankland alive or dead? Had he himself\\npaused too long on the brink, and was the heir of Wodensbourne gone, out\\nof all his privileges and superiorities? This was the interpretation\\nthat appeared most likely to Colin. It seemed to him to explain Lady\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s tears and pathos of gratitude. The tutor had suffered in his\\nattempt to save the son, and the parents, moved by the tenderness of\\ngrief, were thankful for his ineffectual efforts. As he lay awake in the\\nsilence, it appeared to him that this was the explanation; and he too\\nthought with a certain pathos and compunction of Harry--his instinctive\\nrival, his natural opponent. Was it thus he had fallen, so near the\\nbeginning of the way--snatched out of the life which had so many charms,\\nso many advantages for him? As Colin lay alone in the silence, his\\nthoughts went out to that unknown life into which he could not but\\nimagine the other young man, who was yesterday--was it yesterday?--as\\nstrong and life-like as himself, had passed so suddenly. Life had never\\nseemed so fair, so bright, so hopeful to himself as while he thus\\nfollowed with wistful eyes the imaginary path of Harry into the unknown\\nawe and darkness. The thought touched him deeply, profoundly, with\\nwistful pity, with wonder and inquiry. Where was he now, this youth who\\nhad so lately been by his side? Had he found out those problems that\\ntrouble men for their life long? Had existence grown already clear and\\nintelligible to the eyes which in this world had cared but little to\\ninvestigate its mysteries?\\n\\nWhile Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind was thus occupied, it occurred to him suddenly to\\nwonder why he himself was so ill and so feeble. He had no inclination to\\nget up from the bed on which he lay. Sometimes he coughed, and the cough\\npained him; his very breathing was a fatigue to him now and then. As he\\nlay pondering this new thought, curious half-recollections, as of things\\nthat had happened in a dream, came into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind; visions of doctors\\nexamining some one--he scarcely knew whether it was himself or\\nanother--and of conversations that had been held over his bed. As he\\nstruggled through these confusing mazes of recollection or imagination,\\nhis head began to ache and his heart to beat; and finally his uneasy\\nmovements woke the nurse, who was alarmed and would not listen to any of\\nthe questions he addressed to her. â\\x80\\x9cMy lady told you as youâ\\x80\\x99d hear\\neverything to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s attendant; â\\x80\\x9cfor goodness gracious\\nsake take your draught, do, and lie still; and donâ\\x80\\x99t go a-moidering and\\na-bothering, and take away a poor womanâ\\x80\\x99s character, as was never known\\nto fall asleep before, nor wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t but for thinking you was better and\\ndidnâ\\x80\\x99t want nothing.â\\x80\\x9d It was strange to the vigorous young man, who had\\nnever been in the hands of a nurse in his life, to feel himself\\nconstrained to obey--to feel, indeed, that he had no power to resist,\\nbut was reduced to utter humiliation and dependence, he could not tell\\nhow. He fell asleep afterwards, and dreamed of Harry Frankland drowning,\\nand of himself going down, down through the muddy, black water--always\\ndown, in giddy circles of descent, as if it were bottomless. When he\\nwoke again it was morning, and his attendant was putting his room to\\nrights, and disposed to regard himself with more friendly eyes. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou go disturbing of yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said the nurse, â\\x80\\x9cand persuading of the\\ndoctor as you ainâ\\x80\\x99t no better. Youâ\\x80\\x99re a deal better, if he did but know\\nit. Whatâ\\x80\\x99s come to you? Itâ\\x80\\x99s all along of falling in the canal that\\nnight along of Mr. Harry. If you takes care, and donâ\\x80\\x99t get no more cold,\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll do well.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAlong with Mr. Harry--poor Harry!--and he--?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. His own voice\\nsounded very strange to him, thin and far-off, like a shadow of its\\nformer self. When he asked this question, the profoundest wistful pity\\nfilled the young manâ\\x80\\x99s heart. He was sorry to the depths of his soul for\\nthe other life which had, he supposed, gone out in darkness. â\\x80\\x9cPoor\\nFrankland!â\\x80\\x9d he repeated to himself, with an action of mournful regret.\\n_He_ had been saved, and the other lost. So he thought, and the thought\\nwent to his heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Harry was saved, sir, when you was drownded,â\\x80\\x9d said the nurse, who\\nwas totally unconscious of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s feelings; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s fine and hearty\\nagain, is Mr. Harry. Bless you, a ducking ainâ\\x80\\x99t nothing to him. As for\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d continued the woman, going calmly about her occupations--â\\x80\\x9cthey say\\nit wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the drowning, it was the striking against----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He stopped her further explanations with a\\ncurious sharpness which he was not responsible for, and at which he\\nhimself wondered. Was not he glad that Harry Frankland lived? But then,\\nto be sure, there came upon him the everlasting contrast--the good\\nfortune and unfailing luck of his rival, who was well and hearty, while\\nColin, who would have been in no danger but for him, lay helpless in\\nbed! He began to chafe at himself, as he lay, angry and impotent,\\nsubmitting to the nurseâ\\x80\\x99s attentions. What a poor weakling anybody must\\nthink him, to fall ill of the ducking which had done no harm to Harry!\\nHe felt ridiculous, contemptible, weak--which was the worst of\\nall--thinking with impatience of the thanks which presently Lady\\nFrankland would come to pay him, and the renewed obligations of which\\nthe family would be conscious. If he only could get up, and get back to\\nhis own room! But, when he made the attempt, Colin was glad enough to\\nfall back again upon his pillows, wondering and dismayed. Harry was\\nwell, and had taken no harm; what could be the meaning of _his_ sudden\\nand unlooked-for weakness?\\n\\nLady Frankland came into the room, as he had foreseen, while it was\\nstill little more than daylight of the winter morning. She had always\\nbeen kind to Colin--indifferently, amiably kind, for the most part, with\\na goodness which bore no particular reference to him, but sprang from\\nher own disposition solely. This time there was a change. She sat down\\nby his side with nervous, wistful looks, with an anxious, almost\\nfrightened expression. She asked him how he was with a kind of tremulous\\ntenderness, and questioned the nurse as to how he had slept. â\\x80\\x9cI am so\\nglad to hear you have had a refreshing sleep,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with an anxious\\nsmile, and even laid her soft white hand upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s and caressed it as\\nhis own mother might have done, whilst she questioned his face, his\\naspect, his looks, with the speechless scrutiny of an anxious woman.\\nSomehow these looks, which were so solicitous and wistful, made Colin\\nmore impatient than ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am at a loss to understand why I am lying here,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a\\nforced smile; â\\x80\\x9cI used to think I could stand a ducking as well as most\\npeople. It is humiliating to find myself laid up like a child by a touch\\nof cold water----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Campbell, pray donâ\\x80\\x99t say so,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland; â\\x80\\x9cit was not\\nthe cold water; you know you struck against---- Oh, how can we thank you\\nenough!--how can I ever express my gratitude!â\\x80\\x9d said the poor lady,\\ngrasping his hands in both hers, while her eye filled unawares with\\ntears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is no need for gratitude,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, drawing away his hand with\\nan impatience which he could not have explained. â\\x80\\x9cI am sorry to find\\nmyself such a poor creature that I have to be nursed, and give you\\ntrouble. Your son is all right, I hear.â\\x80\\x9d This he said with an effort at\\nfriendliness which cost him some trouble. He scorned to seem to envy the\\nyoung favourite of fortune, but it was annoying to feel that the\\nstrength he was secretly proud of had given way at so slight a trial. He\\nturned his face a little more towards the wall, and away from Harryâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmother, as he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland, â\\x80\\x9che is quite well, and he is very, very\\ngrateful to you, dear Mr. Campbell. Believe me, we are all very\\ngrateful. Harry is so shy; and he has never once had an opportunity to\\npay you that--that attention which you deserve at his hands; and it\\nshowed such noble and disinterested regard on your part----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPray donâ\\x80\\x99t say so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, abruptly; â\\x80\\x9cyou make me uncomfortable;\\nthere was no regard whatever in the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, yes! you say so to lighten our sense of obligation,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady\\nFrankland. â\\x80\\x9cIt is so good, so kind of you. And when I think what it has\\nmade you suffer--but I am sure you will believe that there is nothing we\\nwould not do to show our gratitude. If you were our own son neither Sir\\nThomas nor I could be more anxious. We have sent for Sir Apsley Wendown,\\nand I hope he will arrive to-day; and we have sent for your dear Mother,\\nMr. Campbell----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy mother?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He was so much startled that he raised himself\\nup on his pillows without thinking, and as he did so was seized by a\\nhorrible pain which took away his breath. â\\x80\\x9cSir Apsley Wendown and my\\nmother? What does it mean?â\\x80\\x9d the young man said gasping, as he managed to\\nslide down again into his former recumbent position. â\\x80\\x9cAm I ill? or does\\nall this commotion arise simply from an unlooked-for ducking and a knock\\nagainst the side of the canal.â\\x80\\x9d He got this out with difficulty, though\\nhe strove with all his might to conceal the trouble it gave him; then he\\nturned his eyes to Lady Frankland, who sat wringing her hands and full\\nof agitation by his bedside. The poor lady had altogether lost her\\ngood-natured and amiable composure. Whatever she had to say to him,\\nwhatever the character of the communication might be, it disturbed her\\ngreatly. She wrung her hands, and gave him a painful hurried glance, and\\nthen withdrew her eyes from his inquiring looks. All this time Colin lay\\nimpatient, looking at her, wondering, with a sharp sensation of anger,\\nwhat she could have to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDear Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d she said at length, â\\x80\\x9cyou are ill; you have been\\nwandering and insensible. Oh, it is hard to think you are suffering for\\nyour goodness, suffering for us! We could not trust you to our doctor\\nhere after we knew; we thought it best to have the best advice, and we\\nthought you would prefer to have your mother. I would have nursed you\\nmyself and tended you night and day,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland, with\\nenthusiasm; â\\x80\\x9cI owe you that and a great deal more; you who have saved my\\ndear boy.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter with me?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. It appeared to him as if a\\ngreat cloud was rolling up over the sky, throwing upon him a strange and\\nominous shadow. He scarcely heard what she said. He did not pay any\\nattention to her. What was Henry Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s mother to him, or her\\nthanks, or the things she was willing to do to show her gratitude? He\\nwanted to know why he was lying there powerless, unable to move himself.\\nThat was the first thing to be thought of. As for Lady Frankland, she\\nwrung her hands again, and hesitated more and more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope God will reward you,â\\x80\\x9d said the agitated woman; â\\x80\\x9cI would give\\neverything I have in the world to see you well and strong as you were\\nwhen you came here. Oh, Mr. Campbell, if you only could know the feeling\\nthat is in all our hearts!â\\x80\\x9d It was her kindness, her reluctance to give\\nhim pain, her unfeigned distress, that made her prolong Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsuspense, and drive him frantic with these exasperating professions of\\nregard, for which, true as they doubtless were, he did not care.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose Iâ\\x80\\x99ve broken some of my bones,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cit would be real\\nkindness if you would tell me what is the matter. Will it take a long\\ntime to mend me? I should be glad to know, at least, what it is.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nImpelled by his looks and his tone, Lady Frankland burst into her\\nstatement at last. â\\x80\\x9cYou have broken some of your ribs,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cbut I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t think that is of so much importance; Sir Apsley, when he comes,\\nwill tell us. He is coming to-day and you are looking so much better. It\\nwas old Mr. Eyre who gave us such a fright yesterday. He said your lungs\\nhad been injured somehow, and that you might never--that it might be a\\nlong time--that it might keep you delicate; but even if that were the\\ncase, with care and a warm climate--oh, Mr. Campbell! I think he is\\nmistaken; he is always such a croaker. I think--I hope--I am almost sure\\nSir Apsley will set you all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAgain Colin had risen in his bed with a little start. This time he was\\nscarcely sensible of the pain which every motion caused him. He fancied\\nafterwards that for that moment his heart stood still in his bosom, and\\nthe pulses in his veins stopped beating. The shock was so strange, so\\nsudden, so unlooked-for. He sat up--struggled up--upon his pillows, and\\ninstinctively and unawares faced and confronted the new Thing which\\napproached him. In that moment of strange consciousness and revelation\\nhe felt as if the intimation was true--as if his doom was sealed and his\\ndays numbered. He did not look at the anxious woman who was wringing her\\narms by his bedside, nor at any external object; but with an\\nirresistible impulse confronted dumbly the new world--the changed\\nexistence. When he laid himself down again it seemed to Colin as if\\nyears had passed over his head. He said some vague words of thanks,\\nwithout being very well aware what he was saying, to Lady Frankland, and\\nthen lay silent, stunned and bewildered, like a man who had received a\\nblow. What she said to him afterwards, or how long she remained in the\\nroom, he was scarcely aware of. Colin belonged to a race which had no\\nweak members; he had been used to nothing but strength and\\nhealth--wholesome rural life and vigour--all his days. He had even\\nlearned, without knowing it, to take a certain pride in his own physical\\ngifts, and in those of his family, and to look with compassionate\\ncontempt on people who were â\\x80\\x9cdelicateâ\\x80\\x9d and obliged to take care of\\nthemselves. The idea that such a fate might by any possibility fall to\\nhimself had never once occurred to him. It was an impossible contingency\\nat which, even a week ago, the strong young man, just entering upon the\\nfull possession of his powers, would have laughed, as beyond the range\\nof imagination. He might die, no doubt, like any other man--might be\\nsnatched out of the world by violent disease or sudden fever, as other\\nstrong men had been; but to have his strength stolen from him while\\nstill his life remained, had appeared a thing beyond the bounds of\\npossibility until now.\\n\\nBut as Colin lay helpless, stunned by this unlooked-for downfall, there\\ncame before his eyes, as vividly as if he saw them in actual presence,\\nthe sick people of his native district--the young men and the young\\nwomen who now and then paid, even on the sweet shores of the Holy Loch,\\nthe terrible toll which consumption takes of all the nations of the\\nnorth. One of them, a young man about his own age, who like himself had\\nbeen in training for the Scotch Church, whom Colin had pitied with all\\nhis kind heart--with the deepest half-remorseful sense of his own\\nsuperior happiness--came before him with intense distinctness as he lay\\nstruck silent by the cold shadow of fate. He could almost have thought\\nthat he saw the spectral attenuated form, with its hectic cheeks, its\\nthin, long, wasted hands, its preternatural length of limb, seated in\\nthe old, high-backed easy-chair in the farmhouse parlour. All the\\ninvalidâ\\x80\\x99s life appeared to him in a sudden flash of recollection; the\\nkindly neighboursâ\\x80\\x99 visits; the books and papers which were lent him; the\\nsoup and jellies which the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s wife and the other ladies of the\\nparish, few in number as they were, kept him provided with. Colin could\\neven remember his own periodical visits; his efforts to think what would\\ninterest the sick man; his pity, and wonder, and almost contempt, for\\nthe patience which could endure, and even take a pleasure in, the poor\\ncomforts of the fading life. God help him! was this what he himself was\\ncoming to? was this all he had to anticipate? Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart gave a\\nstrange leap in his breast at the thought. A sudden wild throb, a sense\\nof something intolerable, a cry against the fate which was too hard,\\nwhich could not be borne, rose within him, and produced a momentary\\nsickness which took the light out of his eyes, and made everything swim\\nround him in a kind of dizzy gloom. Had he been standing he would have\\nfallen down, and the bystanders would have said he had fainted. But he\\nhad not fainted; he was bitterly, painfully conscious of everything. It\\nwas only his heart that fluttered in his breast like a wounded bird; it\\nwas only his mind that had been struck, and reeled. So much absorbed was\\nhe that he did not hear the voice of the nurse, who brought him some\\ninvalid nourishment, and who became frightened when she got no answer,\\nand shook him violently by the arm. â\\x80\\x9cLord bless us, heâ\\x80\\x99s gone,â\\x80\\x9d\\nexclaimed the woman; and she was but little reassured when her patient\\nturned upon her with dry lips and a glittering eye. â\\x80\\x9cI am not gone yet,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin; â\\x80\\x9cthere is no such luck for me;â\\x80\\x9d and then he began once more\\nto picture out to himself the sick man at the Holy Loch, with the little\\ntray on the table beside him, and his little basin of soup. God help\\nhim! was this how he was to be for all the rest of his life?\\n\\nThis was how he sustained the first physical shock of the intimation\\nwhich poor Lady Frankland had made to him with so much distress and\\ncompunction. It is hard enough at any time to receive a sentence of\\ndeath; yet Colin could have died bravely had that been all that was\\nrequired of him. It was the life in death thus suddenly presented before\\nhis eyes that appalled his soul and made his heart sick. And after that,\\nHeaven knows, there were other considerations still more hard to\\nencounter. If we were to say that the young man thus stopped short in\\nthe heyday of his life bethought himself immediately of what is called\\npreparation for dying, it would be false and foolish. Colin had a\\ndesperate passage to make before he came to that. As these moments,\\nwhich were like hours, passed on, he came to consider the matter in its\\nlarger aspects. But for Harry Frankland he would have been in no danger,\\nand now Harry Frankland was safe, strong, and in the full enjoyment of\\nhis life, while Colin lay broken and helpless, shipwrecked at the\\nbeginning of his career. Why was it? Had God ordained this horrible\\ninjustice, this cruel fate? As Colin looked at it, out of the clouds\\nthat were closing round him, that fair career which was never to be\\naccomplished stretched bright before him, as noble a future as ever was\\ncontemplated by man. It had its drawbacks and disadvantages when he\\nlooked at it a week before, and might, perhaps, have turned out a\\ncommon-place life enough had it come to its daily fulfilment; but now,\\nwhen it had suddenly become impossible, what a career it seemed! Not of\\nselfish profit, of money-making, or personal advantage--a life which was\\nto be for the use of his country, for the service of his Church, for the\\nfurtherance of everything that was honest and lovely, and of good\\nreport. He stood here, stayed upon the threshold of his life, and looked\\nat it with wonder and despair. This existence God had cut short and put\\nan end to. Why? That another man might live and enjoy his common-place\\npleasures--might come into possession of all the comforts of the world,\\nmight fill a high position without knowing, without caring for it; might\\nhunt, and shoot, and fall asleep after dinner as his father had done\\nbefore him. In the great darkness Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart cried out with a cry of\\nanguish and terrible surprise to the invisible, inexorable God, â\\x80\\x9cWhy?\\nWhy?â\\x80\\x9d Was one of His creatures less dear, less precious to Him than\\nanother, that He should make this terrible difference? The pure life,\\nthe high hopes, the human purpose and human happiness, were they as\\nnothing to the great Creator who had brought them into being and\\nsuffered them to bud and blossom only that He might crush them with His\\nhands? Colin lay still in his bed, with his lips set close and his eyes\\nstraining into that unfathomable darkness. The bitterness of death took\\npossession of his soul--a bitterness heavier, more terrible than that of\\ndeath. His trust, his faith, had given way. God sat veiled upon his\\nawful throne, concealed by a horrible cloud of disappointment and\\nincomprehension. Neither love nor justice, neither mercy nor equal\\ndealing, was in this strange, unintelligible contrast of one manâ\\x80\\x99s loss\\nand another manâ\\x80\\x99s gain. As the young man lay struggling in this hour of\\ndarkness, the God of his youth disappeared from him, the Saviour of his\\nchildhood withdrew, a sorrowful shadow, into the angry heavens. What was\\nleft? Was it a capricious Deity, ruled by incomprehensible impulses of\\nfavour and of scorn? Was it a blind and hideous Chance, indifferent\\nalike to happiness and misery? Was it some impious power, owning no\\neverlasting rule of right and wrong, of good and evil, who trampled at\\nits will upon the hearts and hopes of men? Colin was asking himself\\nthese terrible questions when the curtain was softly drawn, and a face\\nlooked down upon him, in which tenderness and grief and pity had come to\\nsuch a climax as no words could convey any impression of. It was his\\nmother who stood beside him, stretching out her arms like a pitying\\nangel, yearning over him with the anguish and the impatience of love.\\nSometimes, surely, the Master gives us in the fellowship of His\\nsufferings a human pang beyond His own--the will to suffer in the stead\\nof those we love, without the power.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 grateful, Colin--I canna but say that for them,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMrs. Campbell; â\\x80\\x9cand as anxious as if you were their own son. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\nundertake to say that I havena an unchristian feeling myself to Harry\\nFrankland; but, when youâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 weel and strong, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd what if I am never well and strong?â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. His\\nmotherâ\\x80\\x99s presence had subdued and silenced, at least, for a time, the\\nwild questions in his heart. She had taken them upon herself, though he\\ndid not know it. So far human love can stretch its fellowship in the\\nsufferings of its Master,--not to the extent of substitution, of\\nsalvation temporal or spiritual, but, at least, to a modified\\ndeliverance. She had soothed her son and eased him of his burden, but in\\nso doing had taken it to herself. The eagle that had been gnawing his\\nheart had gone to fix its talons in hers; but she carried it like the\\nSpartan, under her mantle, and smiled while it rent her in twain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhisht, whisht!â\\x80\\x9d she said, in her martyrdom of composure and calm\\nlooks, and took her boyâ\\x80\\x99s hand and held it between hers--God only could\\ntell how fondly--with a firm, warm grasp that seemed to hold him fast to\\nlife. â\\x80\\x9cColin, my man, itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 in Godâ\\x80\\x99s hands,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress of\\nRamore; â\\x80\\x9cwhiles His ways are awfuâ\\x80\\x99 mysterious. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no one that pretends\\nto read them, or see aâ\\x80\\x99thing plain, like some folk; but I canna think He\\never makes a mistake or lets anything go by hazard. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll bide His time,\\nColin; and who can tell what mercy and goodness he may have in His\\nhand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMercy and goodness, or, perhaps, the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. If he had\\nnot been a little comforted and eased in his heart, he would not have\\ngiven utterance to words which he felt to be unchristian. But now, with\\nhis longing to be soothed and to accept the softening influence which\\nsurrounded him, came an impulse to speak,--to use words which were even\\nmore strong than his feelings. As for his mother, she was too\\nthoughtful a woman, and had in her own heart too heavy a burden, to be\\nshocked by what he said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe what appears to us the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cthough that maun be\\nbut an appearance, like most things in this life. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no one to deny my\\nain heart, or make a show as if I understood the ways of the Lord, or\\ncould, aye, in my poor way, approve of them, if a mortal creature might\\ndaur to say so, Colin. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s things He does that appear aâ\\x80\\x99 wrang to\\nme--I canna but say it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no doubting His wisdom nor yet His love, but\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s mony a thing He does that I canna follow, nor see onything in\\nbut loss and misery. But oh, Colin, my bonnie man, thatâ\\x80\\x99s nae cause for\\ndoubting Him! He maun have His ain reasons, and they maun be better\\nreasons than ours. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll close your eyes, and try and get a sleep,\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll take a breath of air to myself before night sets in. I was aye an\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 woman for the air; and eh, laddie! I think yeâ\\x80\\x99ll be thankful to\\nget back to Ramore after this dreary country, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s neither hill\\nnor glen--though maybe it might be cauld for you in the spring, when\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s so much soft weather,â\\x80\\x9d said the tender woman, smoothing his\\npillows, and bending over him with her anxious smile. â\\x80\\x9cIt minds me oâ\\x80\\x99\\nthe time when you were my baby, Colin, to get you into my hands again.\\nThey say a womanâ\\x80\\x99s aye a queen in a sick room,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress. Her\\nsmile was such that tears would have been less sad; and she was\\nimpatient to be gone--to leave her sonâ\\x80\\x99s bedside--because she felt\\nherself at the furthest stretch of endurance, and knew that her strained\\npowers must soon give way. Perhaps Colin, too, understood what it was\\nthat made his mother so anxious to leave him, for he turned his face to\\nthe waning evening light, and closed his eyes, and after a while seemed\\nto sleep. When he had lain thus quietly for some time, the poor mother\\nstole downstairs and out into the wintry twilight. Her heart was\\nbreaking in her tender bosom; her strength had been strained to the\\nutmost bounds of possibility; and nature demanded at least the relief of\\ntears.\\n\\nTwo days before the Mistress had been tranquil and content in her\\npeaceful life at home. When Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s telegram came late at\\nnight, like a sudden thunderbolt into the quiet house, the Holy Loch was\\nasleep and at rest, cradled in sweet darkness, and watched by fitful\\nglances of that moon for which Colin and his friends had looked to guide\\nthem on the night of the accident; and no means of communicating with\\nthe world until the morning was possible to the inhabitants of Ramore.\\nThe anxious mother, whose eyes had not been visited with sleep through\\nall the lingering winter night, set off by dawn to thread her weary\\nunaccustomed way through all the mazes of the railways which were to\\nconvey her to Wodensbourne. She had neither servant nor friend to manage\\nfor her; and no fine lady, accustomed to the most careful guardianship,\\ncould be more unused to the responsibilities of travelling than Mrs.\\nCampbell. When she arrived, it was to find her boy, her firstborn,\\nstretched helpless upon his bed, to see the examination made by the\\ngreat doctor from London, to hear his guarded statements, his\\nfeebly-expressed hopes, which conveyed only despair--and with that\\nsudden arrow quivering in her heart to undertake the duties of a\\ncheerful nurse--to keep smiling upon Colin, telling him the news of the\\nparish, and the events of the countryside, as if her coming here had\\nbeen a holiday. All this, put together--though so many women have borne\\nit, and though the Mistress of Ramore was able to bear it, and more, for\\nher boyâ\\x80\\x99s sake--was a hard strain upon her. When she got downstairs into\\nthe air, the first thing she did was to sit down on the steps of the\\nglass door which led into the terrace and cry bitterly and silently. She\\nwas alone among strangers, with scarcely even a friendly feature of\\nfamiliar nature to give her a little confidence. The aspect of the great\\nhouse, stretching its long wings and solemn front into the twilight,\\ncontaining a whole community of people unknown to her, whose very voices\\nwere strange and sounded like a foreign tongue, completed the forlorn\\nsense she had of absence from everything that could help or console; and\\nwhen, in the restlessness of her musing, she got up and began to walk\\nabout upon that deserted terrace which Colin had paced so often, all\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s questions, all his doubts, rushed with double force and feminine\\npassion into his motherâ\\x80\\x99s mind.\\n\\nAs she pursued her uncertain way, her eye was attracted by the lights in\\nthe windows. One of them was large and low, and so close upon the\\nterrace that she could not help seeing the interior, and what was\\npassing there. Harry Frankland was standing by the fire with his cousin.\\nThe long billiard-table behind them, and the cue which Miss Matty still\\nheld in her hand, did not enlighten Mrs. Campbell as to what they had\\nbeen doing. Matty had laid her disengaged hand on her cousinâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder,\\nand was looking up, as if pleading for something, into his face; and the\\nfire-light which gleamed upon them both, gave colour and brightness to\\nthe two young faces, which seemed to the sorrowful woman outside to be\\nglowing with health and love and happiness. When Mrs. Campbell looked\\nupon this scene her heart cried out in her breast. It was Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nquestion that came to her lips as she hurried past in the cold and the\\ngathering darkness--â\\x80\\x9cWhy? Oh God! why?â\\x80\\x9d Her son struck to the earth in\\nthe bloom of his young life--rooted up like a young tree, or a silly\\nflower--and this youth, this other womanâ\\x80\\x99s son, taking the happiness\\nwhich should have been for Colin. Why was it? The poor woman called in\\nher misery upon the heavens and the earth to answer her. One deprived of\\nall, another possessed of everything that soul of man could desire; one\\nheart smitten and rent asunder, and another filled to overflowing with\\nsafety and happiness.\\n\\nAs she went on in her haste, without knowing where she went, another\\nwindow caught the Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s eye. It was the nursery window where all\\nthe little ones were holding high carnival. Little boys and little\\ngirls, the younger branches of the large happy family, with again the\\nlight gleaming rosy over their childish faces. One of them was having\\nher toilette made for presentation in the drawing-room, and at sight of\\nher another blow, keen and poignant, went to Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s heart. Just\\nsuch a child had been the little maiden, the little daughter who once\\nmade sunshine in the homely house of Ramore. It came upon the poor\\nmother in the darkness to think what that child would have been to her\\nnow had she lived--how her woman child would have suffered with her,\\nwept with her, helped to bear the burden of her woe. Her heart yearned\\nand longed in her new grief over the little one who had been gone so\\nmany years. She turned away hastily from the bright window and the gay\\ngroup and sank down upon her knees on the ground with a sob that came\\nfrom her heart--â\\x80\\x9cWhy? oh why?â\\x80\\x9d God had His reasons, but what were they?\\nThe agony of loss, in which there seemed no possible gain; the\\nbitterness of suffering, without knowing any reason for it, overpowered\\nher. The contrast of her own trouble with the happiness, the full\\npossession, the universal prosperity and comfort which she saw, struck\\nher sharply with something which was not envy of her neighbour, but the\\nappeal of an amazed anguish to God. â\\x80\\x9cThe ways of the Lord are not\\nequal,â\\x80\\x9d she was saying in her soul. Was it, as Nature suggested, with\\nnatural groans, because He loved her less--or, as the minister said,\\nbecause He loved her more, that God sent upon her those pangs, and\\ndemanded from her those sacrifices? Thus she cried out of the depths,\\nnot knowing what she said. â\\x80\\x9cIf I had but had my Jeanie!â\\x80\\x9d the poor woman\\nmoaned to herself, with a vision of a consoling angel, a daughter,\\nanother dearer, fairer self, who would have helped to bear all her\\nburdens. But God had not afforded her that comfort, the dearest\\nconsolation to a woman. When she had wept out those few bitter tears,\\nthat are all of which the heart is capable when it is no longer young,\\nshe gathered herself up out of the darkness and prepared to go back\\nagain to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s bedside. Though she had received no answer to her\\nquestion--though neither God Himself nor His angels, nor any celestial\\ncreature, had gleamed through the everlasting veil, and given her a\\nglimpse of that Divine meaning which it is so hard to read--there was a\\ncertain relief in the question itself, and in the tears that had been\\nwrung out of her heart. And so it was that, when Matty Frankland came\\nlightly out of the billiard-room, on her way to dress for dinner, Mrs.\\nCampbell, whom she met coming in from the terrace, did not appear to her\\nto bear a different aspect from that which the Mistress of Ramore had\\nborne in other days.\\n\\nMatty did not lose a minute in making her advances to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother.\\nShe was, indeed, extremely sorry, and had even been conscious of a\\npassing thought similar to that which had struggled passionately into\\nbeing, both in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind and in his motherâ\\x80\\x99s--a passing sense of\\nwonder why Harry, who was good for nothing in particular, should have\\nbeen saved, and Colin, who was what Miss Matty called â\\x80\\x9cso very clever,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshould have been the sufferer. Such a doubt, had it gone deep\\nenough--had it become an outcry of the soul, as it was with the\\nothers--would have made an infidel of that little woman of the world.\\nShe ran to Mrs. Campbell, and took her hand, and led her into the\\nbilliard-room, the door of which stood open. â\\x80\\x9cOh, dear Mrs. Campbell,\\ncome and tell me about him,â\\x80\\x9d she said; and, as it had been the\\nconjunction of a little real feeling with her habitual wiles that\\nbrought Colin under her influence, the same thing moved his mother at\\nleast to tolerate the inquiry. She drew away her hand with some\\nimpatience from the little enchantress, but her tender heart smote her\\nwhen she saw an involuntary tear in Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s eye. Perhaps, after all, it\\nwas less her fault than her misfortune; and the Mistress followed the\\ngirl into the room with less dislike, and more toleration, than she\\ncould have supposed possible. It might be, after all, the older\\npeople--to whom worldliness came by nature, as she was disposed to\\nthink--who were to blame.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mrs. Campbell, I am so sorry; I cannot tell you how sorry I am,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncried Matty--- and she spoke only the truth, and had real tears in her\\neyes--â\\x80\\x9cto think that he should save my cousin again, and suffer so for\\nhis goodness. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with us--though, indeed, I should not\\nwonder if you could not bear our very name--I am sure I could not, if I\\nwere you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNa, God forbid,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress. She was but half-satisfied of the\\nreality of the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s professions, and this suspicion, so unusual\\nto her, gave dignity to her speech. â\\x80\\x9cIt wasna you nor ony mortal person,\\nbut his own heart that moved my Colin. You could do an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, looking with a womanâ\\x80\\x99s look of disapproving admiration\\non Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s pretty face, â\\x80\\x9cbut you couldna move my son like his ain\\ngenerous will. He never was one to think of his ain--comfort--â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Mrs. Campbell with a little shudder, for something in her\\nthroat prevented her from saying his life--â\\x80\\x9cwhen a fellow creature was\\nin danger. It was his ain heart that was to blame--if anything was to\\nblame--and not you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd the homely womanâ\\x80\\x99s eyes went beyond her questioner with that same\\nlook which in Colin had so often baffled Miss Matty, showing that the\\nhigher spirit had gone past the lesser into its own element, where only\\nits equals could follow. The girl was awed for the moment and humbled.\\nNot for her poor sake, not for Harry Frankland, who was of no great\\naccount to anybody out of his immediate family--but because of his own\\nnature, which would not permit him to see another perish, had Colin\\nsuffered. This thought, imperfectly as she understood it, stopped the\\nvoluble sympathy, pity and distress on Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s lips. She no longer knew\\nwhat to say, and, after an awkward pause, could only stammer over her\\nold common-places. â\\x80\\x9cOh, dear Mrs. Campbell, I am so sorry; I would give\\nanything in the world to make him well again; and I only hope you wonâ\\x80\\x99t\\nbe angry with us,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty, with a suppressed sob, which was partly\\nfright and partly feeling. The Mistress came to herself at the sound of\\nthe girlâ\\x80\\x99s voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no angry,â\\x80\\x9d she said--â\\x80\\x9cGod forbid; though I might have something to\\nsay to _you_ if my heart could speak. The like of you whiles do mair\\nharm in this world, Miss Frankland, than greater sinners. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying\\nyou kent what you were doing; but, if it had not been for you, my Colin\\nwould never have come near this place. You beguiled my son with your\\npleasant words and your bonnie face. He had nae mair need to come here\\nto be tutor to yon bit crooked callant,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, with\\ninvoluntary bitterness, â\\x80\\x9cthan Maister Frankland himself. But he thought\\nto be near you, that had beguiled him and made him give mair heed to\\nyour fables than to anything that was true in life. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no blaming my\\nColin,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, with an unconscious elevation of her head;\\nâ\\x80\\x9che never had kent onything but truth aâ\\x80\\x99 his days, and, if he wasna to\\nbelieve in a woman that smiled on him and enticed him to her, what was\\nhe to believe in at his years? Nor Iâ\\x80\\x99m no to call angry at you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, looking from the elevation of age and nature upon Miss\\nMatty, who drooped instinctively, and became conscious what a trifling\\nlittle soul she was. â\\x80\\x9cWe aâ\\x80\\x99 act according to our ain nature, and you\\nwasna capable of perceiving what harm you could do; but, if you should\\never encounter again one that was true himself and believed in you----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHere Matty, who had never been destitute of feeling, and who, in her\\nheart, was fond of Colin in her way, and had a kind of understanding of\\nhim, so far as she could go, fell into such an outburst of natural tears\\nas disarmed the Mistress, who faltered and stopped short, and had hard\\nado to retain some appearance of severity in sight of this weeping, for\\nwhich she was not prepared. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother understood truth, and in an\\nabhorring, indignant, resentful way, believed that there was falsehood\\nin the world. But how truth and falsehood were mingled--how the impulses\\nof nature might have a little room to work even under the fictions of\\nart or the falseness of society--was a knowledge unimagined by the\\nsimple woman. She began to think she had done Matty injustice when she\\nsaw her tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mrs. Campbell, I know how good he is! I--I never knew any one like\\nhim. How could I help----? But, indeed--indeed, I never meant any harm!â\\x80\\x9d\\ncried Matty, ingeniously taking advantage of the truth of her own\\nfeelings, so far as they went, to disarm her unconscious and\\nsingleminded judge. The Mistress looked at her with puzzled, but pitiful\\neyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would be poor comfort to him to say you never meant it,â\\x80\\x9d she said;\\nand in the pause that followed Matty had begun to recollect that it was\\na long time since the dressing-bell rang, though she still had her face\\nhid on the table, and the tears were not dried from her cheeks. â\\x80\\x9cAnd\\nthings may turn out more merciful than they look like,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nMistress, with a sigh and a wistful smile. Perhaps it occurred to her\\nthat the gratitude of the Franklands might go so far as to bestow upon\\nColin the woman he loved. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no keep you longer,â\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\nlaying her tender hand for a moment on Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s head. â\\x80\\x9cGod bless you for\\nevery kind thought you ever had to my Colin. Heâ\\x80\\x99s weel worthy of them\\nall,â\\x80\\x9d said the wistful mother.\\n\\nMatty, who did not know what to say, and who, under this touch, felt her\\nown artifice, and was for a moment disgusted with herself, sprang up in\\na little agony of shame and remorse, and kissed Mrs. Campbell as she\\nwent away. And Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother went back to her sonâ\\x80\\x99s room to find him\\nasleep, and sat down by his side, to ponder in herself whether this and\\nthat might not still be possible. Love and happiness were physicians in\\nwhom the simple woman had a confidence unbounded. If they came smiling\\nhand in hand to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s pillow, who could tell what miracle of gladness\\nmight yet fall from the tender heavens?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI.\\n\\n\\nBut, though Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s heart relented towards Matty, and was filled\\nwith vague hopes which centred in her, it was very hard to find out what\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were on the same subject. He scarcely spoke of the\\nFranklands at all, and never named or referred to the ladies of the\\nhouse. When his mother spoke, with natural female wiles to tempt him\\ninto confidence, of special inquiries made for him, Colin took no notice\\nof the inference. She even went so far as to refer specially to Miss\\nMatty with no greater effect. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s one in the house as anxious as\\nme,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, with tender exaggeration, as she smoothed his\\npillow and made her morning inquiries; but her son only smiled faintly,\\nand shook his head with an almost imperceptible movement of incredulity.\\nHe asked no questions, showed no pleasure at the thought, but lay most\\nof the day in a silence which his mother could find no means of\\nbreaking.\\n\\nThe first horror, the first resistance, had gone out of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind;\\nbut he lay asking himself inevitable questions, facing the great problem\\nfor which he could find no solution, which no man has been able to\\nexplain. Had the thoughts of his mind been put into words, the chances\\nare that to most people who have never themselves come to such a trial\\nColin would have seemed a blasphemer or an infidel. But he was neither\\nthe one nor the other, and was indeed incapable by nature either of\\nscepticism or of profanity. The youth had been born of a\\nsternly-believing race, which recognised in all Godâ\\x80\\x99s doings an eternal\\nright, beyond justice and beyond reason, a right to deal with them and\\ntheirs as he might please; but Colin himself was of the present age, and\\nwas fully possessed by all those cravings after understanding and\\nexplanation which belong to the time. Without any doubt of God, he was\\narrested by the wonderful mystery of Providence, and stood questioning,\\nin the face of the unanswering silence, â\\x80\\x9cWhy?â\\x80\\x9d The good God, the God of\\nthe Gospels, the Father of our Lord, was the Divine Ruler whom Colin\\nrecognised in his heart; but the young man longed and struggled to find\\nreasonableness, coherence, any recognisable, comprehensible cause, for\\nthe baffling arrangements and disarrangements, the mysterious\\ninequalities and injustices of life. He wanted to trace the thread of\\nreason which God kept in His own hand; he wanted to make out why the\\nFather who loved all should dispense so unequally, so differently, His\\ngifts to one and another. This awful question kept him silent for days\\nand nights; he could not make anything of it. Social inequalities, which\\nspeculatists fret at, had not much disturbed Colin. It had not yet\\noccurred to him that wealth or poverty made much difference; but why the\\nlife of one should be broken off incomplete and that of another go\\non--why the purposes of one should end in nothing, why his hopes should\\nbe crushed and his powers made useless, while another flourished and\\nprospered, confounded him, in the inexperience of his youth. And neither\\nheaven nor earth gave him any answer. The Bible itself seemed to append\\nmoral causes, which were wanting in his case, to the perennial\\ninequalities of existence. It spoke of the wicked great in power,\\nnourishing like the green bay-tree, and of the righteous oppressed and\\nsuffering for righteousnessâ\\x80\\x99 sake; which was, in its way, a\\ncomprehensible statement of the matter. But the facts did not agree in\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s case. Harry Frankland could not, by any exertion of dislike, be\\nmade to represent the wicked, nor was Colin, in his own thinking, better\\nthan his neighbour. They were two sons of one Father, to whom that\\nFather was behaving with the most woeful, the most extraordinary\\npartiality; and nothing in heaven or earth was of half so much\\nimportance as to prove the proceedings of the Father of all to be\\neverlastingly just and of sublime reason. What did it mean? This was\\nwhat Colin was discussing with himself as he lay on his bed. It was not\\nwonderful that such thoughts should obliterate the image of Miss Matty.\\nWhen she came into his mind at all, he looked back upon her with a\\npensive sweetness as on somebody he had known a lifetime before.\\nSterner matters had now taken the place of the light love and hopes of\\nbountiful and lavish youth. The hopes had grown few, and the abundance\\nchanged into poverty. If the author of the change had chosen to reveal\\nthe cause for it, the young soul thus stopped short in his way could\\nhave consented that all was well.\\n\\nAnd then Lady Frankland came every day to pay him a visit of sympathy,\\nand to express her gratitude. â\\x80\\x9cIt is such a comfort to see him looking\\nso much better,â\\x80\\x9d Lady Frankland said; â\\x80\\x9cHarry would like so much to come\\nand sit with you, dear Mr. Campbell. He could read to you, you know,\\nwhen you feel tired; I am sure nothing he could do would be too much to\\nshow his sense of your regard----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which words Colin raised himself up.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should be much better pleased,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cif you would not impute\\nto me feelings which I donâ\\x80\\x99t pretend to. It was no regard for Mr.\\nFrankland that induced me----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, indeed! I know how good you are,â\\x80\\x9d said Harryâ\\x80\\x99s mother, pressing his\\nhand, â\\x80\\x9calways so generous and disposed to make light of your own\\nkindness; but we all know very well, and Harry knows, that there is many\\na brother who would not have done so much. I am sure I cannot express to\\nyou a tenth part of what I feel. Harryâ\\x80\\x99s life is so precious,â\\x80\\x9d said my\\nLady, with a natural human appreciation of her own concerns, and\\nunconscious, unintentional indifference to those of others. â\\x80\\x9cThe eldest\\nson; and Sir Thomas has quite commenced to rely upon him for many\\nthings--and I am sure I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what I should do without Harry to\\nrefer to,â\\x80\\x9d Lady Frankland continued, with a little smile of maternal\\npride and triumph. When she came to this point, it chanced to her to\\ncatch a side glimpse of Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s face. The Mistress sat by her\\nsonâ\\x80\\x99s bedside, pale, with her lips set close, and her eyes fixed upon\\nthe hem of her apron, which she was folding and refolding in her hands.\\nShe did not say anything, nor give utterance in any way to the dumb\\nremonstrance and reproach with which her heart was bursting; but there\\nwas something in her face which imposed silence upon the triumphant,\\nprosperous woman beside her. Lady Frankland gave a little gasp of\\nmingled fright and compunction. She did not know what to say to express\\nher full sense of the service which Colin had done her; and there was\\nnothing strange in her instinctive feeling, that she, a woman used to be\\npetted and tended all her life, had a natural claim upon other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nservices. She was very sorry, of course, about Mr. Campbell; if any\\nexertion of hers could have cured him, he would have been well in\\nhalf-an-hour. But, as it was, it appeared to her rather natural than\\notherwise that the tutor should suffer and that her own son should be\\nsaved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI felt always secure about Harry when you were with him,â\\x80\\x9d she said,\\nwith an involuntary artifice. â\\x80\\x9cHe was so fond of you, Mr. Campbell--and\\nI always felt that you knew how important his safety was, and how much\\ndepended--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; he was angry in his weakness at her\\npertinacity. â\\x80\\x9cI have no right to your gratitude. Your son and I have no\\nlove for each other, Lady Frankland. I picked him out of the canal, not\\nbecause I thought of the importance of his life, but because I had seen\\nhim go down, and should have felt myself a kind of murderer had I not\\ntried to save him. That is the whole. Why should I be supposed to have\\nany special regard for him? Perhaps,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, whose words came\\nslowly and whose voice was interrupted by his weakness--â\\x80\\x9cI would have\\ngiven my life with more comfort for any other man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh Mr. Campbell! donâ\\x80\\x99t be so angry and bitter. After all, it was not\\nour fault,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland, with a wondering offence and\\ndisappointment--and then she hurriedly changed her tone, and began to\\ncongratulate his mother on his improved looks. â\\x80\\x9cI am so glad to see him\\nlooking so much better. There were some people coming here,â\\x80\\x9d said my\\nlady, faltering a little; â\\x80\\x9cwe would not have them come so long as he was\\nso ill. Neither Harry nor any of us could have suffered it. We had sent\\nto put them off; but, now that he is so much better--â\\x80\\x9d said Lady\\nFrankland, with a voice which was half complaint and half appeal. She\\nthought it was rather ill-tempered of the mother and son to make so\\nlittle response. â\\x80\\x9cWhen I almost asked their permission!â\\x80\\x9d she said, with\\na little indignation, when she had gone downstairs; â\\x80\\x9cbut they seem to\\nthink they should be quite masters, and look as black as if we had done\\nthem an injury. Send to everybody, and say it is to be on Wednesday,\\nMatty; for Henryâ\\x80\\x99s interests must not be neglected.â\\x80\\x9d _It_ was a ball,\\nfor which Lady Frankland had sent out her invitations some time before\\nthe accident; for Harry Frankland was to ask the suffrages of the\\nelectors of Earie at the approaching election. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be\\nungrateful to Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said the Lady of Wodensbourne, smoothing\\nher ruffled plumes. â\\x80\\x9cI am sure nobody can say I have not been grateful;\\nbut, at the same time, I canâ\\x80\\x99t be expected to sacrifice my own son.â\\x80\\x9d\\nSuch were the sentiments with which Lady Frankland came downstairs. As\\nfor the other mother, it would be hard to describe what was in her mind.\\nIn the bitterness of her heart she was angry with the God who had no\\npity upon her. If Harry Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s life was precious, what was Colinâ\\x80\\x99s?\\nand the Mistress, in her anguish, made bitter comparisons, and cried out\\nwildly with a womanâ\\x80\\x99s passion. Downstairs, in the fine rooms which her\\nsimple imagination filled with splendour, they would dance and sing\\nunconcerned, though her boyâ\\x80\\x99s existence hung trembling in the balance:\\nand was not Heaven itself indifferent, taking no notice? She was glad\\nthat twilight was coming on to conceal her face, and that Colin, who lay\\nvery silent, did not observe her. And so, while Lady Frankland, feeling\\nrepulsed and injured, managed to escape partially from the burden of an\\nobligation which was too vast to be borne, and returned to the\\nconsideration of her ball, the two strangers kept silence in the\\ntwilight chamber, each dumbly contending with doubts that would not be\\novercome, and questions which could not be answered. What did God mean\\nby permitting this wonderful, this incomprehensible difference between\\nthe two? But the great Father remained silent and made no reply. The\\ndays of revelation, of explanation were over. For one, joy and\\nprosperity; for another, darkness and the shadow of death--plain facts\\nnot to be misconceived or contested--and in all the dumb heavens and\\nsilent observant earth no wisdom nor knowledge which could tell the\\nreason why.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, I heard of the accident. No that I thought anything particular of\\nthat. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no the kind of callant, nor come of the kind of race, to\\ngive in to an accident. I came for my own pleasure. I hope Iâ\\x80\\x99m old\\nenough to ken what pleases myself. Take your dinner, callant, and leave\\nme to mind my business. I could do that much before you were born.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was Lauderdale who made this answer to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s half-pleased,\\nhalf-impatient questioning. The new comer sat, gaunt and strange,\\nthrowing a long shadow over the sick-bed, and looking, with a suppressed\\nemotion, more pathetic than tears, upon the tray which was placed on a\\nlittle table by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s side. It was a sad sight enough. The young man,\\nin the flush and beauty of his youth, with his noble physical\\ndevelopment, and the eager soul that shone in his eyes, laid helpless,\\nwith an invalidâ\\x80\\x99s repast before him, for which he put out his hand with\\na languid movement like a sick child. Lauderdale himself looked haggard\\nand careworn. He had travelled by night, and was unshaven and untrimmed,\\nwith a wild gleam, of exhaustion and hungry anxiety in his eyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatever the reason may be, weâ\\x80\\x99re real glad to see you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\nCampbell. â\\x80\\x9cIf I could have wished for anything to do Colin good more\\nthan heâ\\x80\\x99s getting, it would have been you. But heâ\\x80\\x99s a great deal\\nbetter--a wonderful deal better; you would not know him for the same\\ncreature that he was when I came here; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m in great hopes heâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\nneed to be sent away for the rest of the winter, as the doctor said,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the sanguine mother, who had reasoned herself into hope. She looked\\nwith wistful inquiry as she spoke into Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, trying hard to\\nread there what was the opinion of the new comer. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nhard thing for me to send him away by himselâ\\x80\\x99, and him no strong,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe Mistress, with a hope that his friend would say that Colinâ\\x80\\x99s looks\\ndid not demand such a proceeding, but that health would come back to him\\nwith the sweet air of the Holy Loch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI heard of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cand, to tell the truth, Iâ\\x80\\x99m tired\\nof staying in one place all my life myselâ\\x80\\x99. If a man is to have no more\\ngood of his ain legs than if he were a vegetable, I see no good in being\\na man; it would save an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal of trouble to turn a cabbage at once.\\nSo Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of taking a turn about the world as long as Iâ\\x80\\x99m able;\\nand, if Colin likes to go with me--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich means, mother, that he has come to be my nurse,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nwhose heart was climbing into his throat; â\\x80\\x9cand here I lie like a log,\\nand will never be able to do more than say thanks. Lauderdale--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhisht, callant,â\\x80\\x9d said the tender giant, who stood looking down upon\\nColin with eyes which would not trust themselves to answer the motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nappealing glances; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m terrible fatigued with my life, and no able to\\ntake the trouble of arguing the question. Not that I consent to your\\nproposition, which has a fallacy on the face of it; for it would be a\\nbonnie-like thing to hear you say thanks either to your mother or me.\\nSince Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been in my situation--which, maybe, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll tell you more about\\nby-and-bye, now that my mouthâ\\x80\\x99s opened--Iâ\\x80\\x99ve saved a little siller, a\\nhundred pounds--or maybe mair,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with a momentary\\nsmile, â\\x80\\x9cand I see no reason why I shouldna have my bit holiday as well\\nas other folk. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve worked long for it.â\\x80\\x9d He turned away just then,\\nattracted by a gleam of sunshine at the window, his companion thought,\\nand stood looking out disposing as he best could of a little bitter\\nmoisture that had gathered in the deep corners of his eyes. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99ll no be\\nvery joyful when it comes,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, with a pang of which\\nnobody was aware, and stood forming his lips into an inaudible whistle\\nto conceal how they quivered. He, too, had built high hopes upon this\\nyoung head which was now lying low. He had said to himself, with the\\ninvoluntary bitterness of a mind disappointed and forlorn, that here at\\nleast was a life free from all shadows--free from the fate that seemed\\nto follow all who belonged to himself--through which he might again\\nreconcile himself to Providence, and re-connect himself with existence.\\nAs he stood now, with his back to Colin, Lauderdale was again going over\\nthe burning ploughshares, enduring the fiery ordeal. Once more his\\nunselfish hope was going out in darkness. When he turned round again his\\nlips had steadied into the doleful turn of a familiar air, which was\\nconnected in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind with many an amusing and many a tender\\nrecollection. Between the two people who were regarding him with love\\nand anguish so intense, the sick youth burst into pleasant\\nlaughter--laughter which had almost surprised the bystanders into\\nhelpless tears--and repeated, with firmer breath than Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s, the\\nfragment of his favourite air.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe never gets beyond that bar,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIt carries me back to\\nGlasgow and all the old days. We used to call it Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s pibroch.\\nGive me my dinner, mother. I donâ\\x80\\x99t see what I should grumble about as\\nlong as you and he are by me. Help me to get up, old fellow,â\\x80\\x9d the young\\nman said, holding out his hands; and he ate his invalid meal cheerfully,\\nwith eager questions about all his old companions, and bursts of passing\\nlaughter, which to the ears of his friend were more terrible than so\\nmany groans. As for the Mistress, she had got used by this time to\\nconnect together those two ideas of Colin and a sick-bed, the\\nconjunction of which was as yet misery to Lauderdale; and she was glad\\nin her boyâ\\x80\\x99s pleasure, and took trembling hope from every new evidence\\nof his unbroken spirit. Before long the old current of talk had flowed\\ninto its usual channel; and, but for the strange, novel circumstances\\nwhich surrounded them, one at least of the party might have forgotten\\nfor the moment that they were not in the pleasant parlour of Ramore; but\\nthat one did not see his own countenance, its eloquent brightness, its\\nflashes of sudden colour, and the shining of its too brilliant eyes. But\\nthere could not be any doubt that Colin improved from that moment.\\nLauderdale had secured a little lodging in the village, from which he\\ncame every morning to the â\\x80\\x9ccallant,â\\x80\\x9d in whom his disappointed spirit,\\ntoo careless of personal good, too meditative and speculative for any\\nfurther ambition on his own account, had fixed its last hopes. He even\\ncame, in time, after he had accustomed himself to the young manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nillness, to share, by moments, in the Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s hopes. When Colin at\\nlast got up from his bed, it was Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s arm he leant on. That was\\nan eventful day to the little anxious group in the sick chamber, whose\\nhopes sometimes leapt to certainty, but whose fears, with an intuition\\ndeeper still, sometimes fell to the other extreme, and were hushed in\\nthe silence of an anguish too deep to be fathomed, from which thought\\nitself drew back. It was a bright winter day, with symptoms of spring in\\nthe air, when the young patient got up from his weary bed. Colin made\\nvery light of his weakness in the rising tide of his spirits. He\\nfaultered across the room upon Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s arm, to look out again, as\\nhe said, upon the world. It was an unfortunate moment for his first\\nrenewal of acquaintance with the bright outside sphere of ordinary life,\\nwhich had passed on long ago, and forgotten Colin. The room in which\\nthey had placed him when his illness began was one of the best rooms in\\nthe house, and looked out upon the terrace and the big holly-trees which\\nColin knew so well. It was the morning of the day on which Lady\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s ball was to take place, and symptoms of excitement and\\npreparation were apparent. Immediately in front of the window, when\\nColin looked out, Miss Matty was standing in animated talk with her\\ncousin. They had been loitering about, as people do in the morning about\\na country house, with no particular occupation--for the sun was warm,\\nthough it was still only the end of January--and Matty was at the moment\\nengaged in indicating some special designs of her own which were\\ninvolved in Lady Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s alterations in the flower-garden, for\\nHarryâ\\x80\\x99s approval. She had, indeed, just led him by the sleeve into the\\nmidst of the half-completed design, and was describing circles round him\\nwith the walking-stick which she had taken out of his hand for the\\npurpose, as Colin stood tremulous and uncertain by the window, looking\\nout. Nobody could look brighter than Miss Matty; nobody more happy than\\nthe heir of Wodensbourne. If the sick man had entertained any hope that\\nhis misfortune threw a sympathetic shadow over them, he must now have\\nbeen undeceived very summarily. Colin, however, bore the trial without\\nflinching. He looked at them as if they were miles or ages away, with a\\nstrange smile, which did not seem to the anxious spectators to have any\\nbitterness in it. But he made no remark until he had left the window,\\nand taken his place on the sofa which had been arranged for him by the\\nfire. Then he smiled again, without looking at any one, with abstract\\neyes, which went to the hearts of his attendants. â\\x80\\x9cHow far off the world\\nseems,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI feel as if I ought to be vexed by that pretty\\nscene on the terrace. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think so, mother? But I am not vexed, no\\nmore than if it was a picture. I wonder what it means?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, my man, it means youâ\\x80\\x99re getting strong and no heeding about\\nthem and their vanities,â\\x80\\x9d cried the Mistress, whose indignant eyes were\\nfull of tears; but Colin only shook his head and smiled, and made no\\nreply. _He_ was not indignant. He did not seem to care or be interested\\none way or other; but, as a spectator might have done, mused on the\\nwonderful contrast, and asked himself what God could mean by it?--a\\nquestion which there was no one to answer. Later the curate came to\\nvisit him, as indeed he had done several times before, praying out of\\nhis well-worn prayer-book by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s bedside in a way which at first\\nscandalized the Mistress, who had, however, become used to him by this\\ntime. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s better to speak out of a book than to speak nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\nCampbell had said; â\\x80\\x9cbut eh, Colin, itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 to think that a man like\\nthat hasna a word out of his ain heart to make intercession for his\\nfellow-creatures when theyâ\\x80\\x99re in trouble.â\\x80\\x9d However, the curate was kind,\\nand the mother was speedily mollified. As for that excellent clergyman\\nhimself, he did not at all understand the odd company in which he found\\nhimself when he looked from Colin, of whom he knew most, to the mother\\nwith her thoughtful eyes, and to the gaunt gigantic friend who looked\\nupon everything in a speculative way, of which the curate had an\\ninstinctive suspicion. To-day Colinâ\\x80\\x99s visitor was more instructive and\\nhortatory than was at all usual for him. He spoke of the mercy of God,\\nwhich had so far brought the patient towards recovery, and of the\\nmotives for thankfulness; to which Mrs. Campbell assented with silent\\ntears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and there was a little pause that surprised the\\ncurate. â\\x80\\x9cIt is comfortable to be better,â\\x80\\x9d said the patient; â\\x80\\x9cbut it\\nwould be more than comfortable if one could but know, if one could but\\nguess, what meaning God has in it all. There is Frankland downstairs\\nwith his cousin, quite well,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder does he ever ask\\nhimself why? When one is on the wrong side of the contrast, one feels it\\nmore, I suppose.â\\x80\\x9d The curate had passed Harry Frankland before he came\\nupstairs, and had, perhaps, been conscious in his own mind of a\\nmomentary personal comparison and passing wonder, even at the difference\\nbetween his own lot and that of the heir of Wodensbourne. But he had\\nthought the idea a bad one, and crushed it at once; and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s fancy,\\nthough more justifiable, was of the same description, and demanded\\ninstant extinction.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t grudge him his good fortune, I am sure; and then we know\\nthere must be inequalities in this life,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate. â\\x80\\x9cIt is very\\nmysterious, but nothing goes without compensation; and then we must\\nalways remember that â\\x80\\x98whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ngood clergyman. â\\x80\\x9cYou are young to have so much suffering; but you can\\nalways take comfort in that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you mean me to think that God does not love Harry Frankland,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin, â\\x80\\x9cand makes a favourite of me in this gloomy way? Do you really\\nthink so?--for I cannot be of that opinion, for my part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate, â\\x80\\x9cI am very much grieved to hear\\nyou speaking like this. Did not God give up His own Son to sufferings of\\nwhich we have no conception? Did not He endure----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was for a cause,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. The young manâ\\x80\\x99s voice fell, and the\\nformer bitterness came back upon him. â\\x80\\x9cHe suffered for the best reason,\\nand knew why; but we are in the dark, and know nothing; why is it? One\\nwith all the blessings of life--another stripped, impoverished, brought\\nto the depths, and no reason in it, no cause, no good,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, in\\nthe momentary outcry of his wonder and passion. He was interrupted, but\\nnot by words of sacred consolation. Lauderdale was sitting behind, out\\nof the way, humming to himself, in a kind of rude chant, out of a book\\nhe held in his hand. Nobody had been taking any notice of him, for it\\nwas his way. Now his voice rose and broke in, in an uncouth swell of\\nsound, not unharmonious with the rude verse--\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cTheirs not to reason why,\\n     Theirs not to make reply,\\n     Theirs but to do and die,â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nsaid Lauderdale, with a break of strong emotion in his voice; and he got\\nup and threw down the book, and came forward into the little circle. It\\nwas the first time that he had intimated by so much as a look his\\nknowledge of anything perilous in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s illness. Now he came and stood\\nopposite him, leaning his back against the wall. â\\x80\\x9cCallant,â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nwith a voice that sounded as if it were blown about and interrupted by a\\nstrong wind, â\\x80\\x9cif I were on a campaign, the man I would envy would be him\\nthat was chosen by his general for the forlorn hope--him that went\\nfirst, and met the wildest of the battle. Do you mean to tell me youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nno ready to follow when He puts the colours in your hand?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII.\\n\\n\\nIt was for about six weeks altogether that the Mistress of Ramore\\nremained Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s guest. For half of that time Lauderdale,\\ntoo, tall, and gaunt, and grim, strode daily over the threshold of\\nWodensbourne. He never broke bread, as he himself expressed it, nor made\\nthe slightest claim upon the hospitality of the strangerâ\\x80\\x99s house. On the\\ncontrary, he declined steadily every advance of friendship that was made\\nto him with a curious Scotch pride, extremely natural to him, but odd to\\ncontemplate from the point of view at which the Franklands stood. They\\nasked him to dinner or to lunch as they would have asked any other\\nstranger who happened to come in their way; but Lauderdale was far too\\nself-conscious to accept such overtures. He had come uninvited, an\\nundesired, perhaps unwelcome, visitor; but not for the world would the\\nphilosopher have taken advantage of his position, as Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend, to\\nprocure himself even the comfort of a meal. Not if he had been starving\\nwould he have shared Colinâ\\x80\\x99s dinner or accepted the seat offered him at\\nthe luxurious table below. â\\x80\\x9cNa, na! I came without asking,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cwhen they bid me to their feasts itâ\\x80\\x99s no for your sake,\\ncallant, or for my sake, but for their own sakes--for good breeding, and\\ngood manners, and not to be uncivil. To force a man to give you your\\ndinner out of civility is every bit as shabby an action as to steal it.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m no the man to sorn on Sir Thomas for short time or long.â\\x80\\x9d And, in\\npursuance of this whimsical idea of independence, Lauderdale went back\\nevery evening along the dark country lanes to the little room he had\\nrented in the village, and subdued his reluctant Scotch appetite to the\\nmesses of bacon and beans he found there--which was as severe a test of\\nfriendship as could have been imposed upon him. He was not accustomed to\\nfare very sumptuously at home; but the fare of an English cottager is,\\nif more costly, at least as distasteful to an untravelled Scotch\\nappetite as the native porridge and broth of a Scotch peasant could be\\nto his neighbour over the Tweed. The greasy meal filled Lauderdale with\\ndisgust, but it did not change his resolution. He lived like a Spartan\\non the bread which he could eat, and came back daily to his faithful\\ntendance of the young companion who now represented to him almost all\\nthat he loved in the world. Colin grew better during these weeks. The\\nair of home which his mother brought with her, the familiar discussions\\nand philosophies with which Lauderdale filled the weary time, gave him a\\nconnecting link once more with the old life. And the new life again rose\\nbefore Colin, fresh, and solemn, and glorious. Painfully and sharply he\\nhad been delivered from his delusions--those innocent delusions which\\nwere virtues. He began to see that, if indeed there ever was a woman in\\nthe world for whom it was worth a manâ\\x80\\x99s while to sacrifice his existence\\nand individuality, Miss Matty, of all women, was not she. And after this\\ndivergence out of his true path, after this cloud that had come over\\nhim, and which once looked as though it might swallow him up, it is not\\nto be described how beautiful his own young life looked to Colin, when\\nit seemed to himself that he was coming back to it, and was about to\\nenter once more upon his natural career.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder how Macdonald will get on at Baliol,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cof course\\nheâ\\x80\\x99ll get the scholarship. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no use regretting what cannot be helped;\\nbut when a man takes the wrong turning once in his life, do you think he\\ncan get into the right road again?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He had scarcely spoken\\nthe words when a smile gradually stealing over his face, faint and soft\\nlike the rising of the moon, intimated to his companions that he had\\nalready answered himself. Not only so, but that the elasticity of his\\nyouth had delivered Colin from all heavier apprehensions. He was not\\nafraid of the wrong turning he had taken. He was but playing with the\\nquestion in a kind of tender wantonness. Neither his health nor his lost\\nopportunity gave him much trouble. The tide of life had risen in his\\nheart, and again everything seemed possible; and, such being the case,\\nhe trifled pleasantly with the dead doubts which existed no longer.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is a tide in the affairs of men,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said to himself, smiling\\nover it; and the two people who were looking at him, whose hearts and\\nwhose eyes were studying every change in his face, saw that a new era\\nhad begun, and did not know whether to exchange looks of gratulation or\\nto betake themselves to the silence and darkness to shed tears of\\ndespair over the false hope.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen a callant goes a step astray, you mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a\\nharshness in his voice which sounded contemptuous to Colin--â\\x80\\x9cgoes out of\\nhis way a step to gather a flower or the like,--a man that takes a wrong\\nturn is altogether a false eemage. Everything in this world is awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nmysterious,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no clear in my mind about that\\nwrong turning. According to some theories thereâ\\x80\\x99s no such thing in\\nexistence. â\\x80\\x98All things work together for good.â\\x80\\x99 I would like to know\\nwhat was in Paulâ\\x80\\x99s head when he wrote down that. No to enter into the\\nquestion of inspiration, the opinion of a man like him is aye worth\\nhaving; but itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 mysterious saying to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, but itâ\\x80\\x99s true,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re no to throw ony of your\\ndoubts upon Providence. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no say but what itâ\\x80\\x99s a hard struggle\\nwhiles; but, if God doesna ken best--if Heâ\\x80\\x99s not the wisest and the\\nkindest--I would rather, for my part, come to an end without ony more\\nado about it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no wanting to live, either in earth or heaven, if\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s ony doubts about Him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s aye the way with women,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, reflectively. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nnae patience for a philosophical question. But the practical argument is\\nno doubt awfuâ\\x80\\x99 powerful, and I can say nothing against it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m greatly\\nof the same way oâ\\x80\\x99 thinking myself. Lifeâ\\x80\\x99s no worth having on less\\nterms; but at the same time--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was speaking only of the Baliol Scholarship,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a\\nmomentary pettishness; â\\x80\\x9cyou are more abstruse than ever, Lauderdale. If\\nthere should happen to be another vacancy next year, do you think Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ninjured myself by neglecting this one? I never felt more disposed for\\nwork,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, raising himself out of his chair. It said a\\ngreat deal for his returning strength that the two anxious spectators\\nallowed him to get up and walk to the window without offering any\\nassistance. The evening was just falling, and Colin looked out upon a\\ngrey landscape of leafless trees and misty flats, over which the shadows\\nwere gathering. He came back again with a little exclamation of\\nimpatience. â\\x80\\x9cI hate these dull levels,â\\x80\\x9d said the restless invalid; â\\x80\\x9cthe\\nearth, and the skies are silent here, and have nothing to say. Mother,\\nwhy do we not go home?â\\x80\\x9d He stood before her for a moment in the twilight\\nlooking, in his diminished bulk and apparently increased height, like a\\nshadow of what he was. Then he threw himself back in his chair with an\\nimpatience partly assumed to conceal the weakness of which he was\\npainfully sensible. â\\x80\\x9cLet us go to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, closing his eyes.\\nHe was in the state of weakness which feels every contradiction an\\ninjury, and already had been more ruffled in spirit than he cared to\\nacknowledge, by the diversion of the talk from his own individual\\nconcerns to a general question so large and so serious. He lay back in\\nhis chair, with his eyes closed, and those clouds of brown hair of which\\nhis mother was so proud hanging heavily over the forehead which, when it\\nwas visible, looked so pale and worn out of its glory of youth. The\\ncolour of day had all gone out of the whispering, solemn twilight; and,\\nwhen the Mistress looked at the face before her, pale, with all its\\noutlines rigid in the grey light, and its eyes closed, it was not\\nwonderful that a shiver went through her heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was just what I had to speak about, Colin, my man,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\nCampbell, nerving herself for the task before her. â\\x80\\x9cI see no reason\\nmyself against it, for Iâ\\x80\\x99ve aye had a great confidence in native air;\\nbut your grand doctor that was brought down from London--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo not say anything more. I shall not stay here, mother; it is\\nimpossible. I am throwing away my life,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, hastily, not\\nwaiting to hear her out. â\\x80\\x9cAnybody can teach that boy. As for the\\nFranklands, I have done enough for them. They have no right to detain\\nme. We will go to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d the young man repeated with the petulance of\\nhis weakness; to which Mrs. Campbell did not know how to reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, Colin, my man,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, after a pause of perplexity,\\nâ\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s no _that_ Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning. Springâ\\x80\\x99s aye sweet, and its sweet aboon aâ\\x80\\x99\\nin your ain place, when ye ken every corner to look for a primrose in. I\\nsaid that to the doctor, Colin, but he wasna of my opinion. Aâ\\x80\\x99 that was\\nin his mind was the east wind (no that thereâ\\x80\\x99s much oâ\\x80\\x99 that in our\\ncountryside, but thae English canna tell one airt from another) and the\\nsoft weather; and I couldna say but what it was whiles damp,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ncandid woman; â\\x80\\x9cand the short and the long is, that he said you were to\\ngang south and no north. If it wasna for your healthâ\\x80\\x99s sake, which keeps\\nfolk anxious, it would sound ower grand to be possible,â\\x80\\x9d she continued,\\nwith a wistful smile, â\\x80\\x9cand awfuâ\\x80\\x99 proud I would be to think of my laddie\\nin Italy--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn Italy!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a cry of excitement and surprise; and then\\nthey both stopped short, and he looked in his motherâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, which would\\nnot meet his, and which he could see, hard as she struggled to keep them\\nunseen, were wet and shining with tears. â\\x80\\x9cPeople are sent to Italy to\\ndie,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. â\\x80\\x9cI suppose that is what the doctor\\nthinks?--and that is your opinion, my poor mother?--and Lauderdale\\nthinks so too? Donâ\\x80\\x99t say No, no; I can see it in your eyes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Colin, dinna say that! dinna break my heart!â\\x80\\x9d cried the Mistress.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m telling you every word the doctor said. He said it would be better\\nfor you in the future; better for your strength, and for getting free of\\ndanger in the many hard winters--dour Scotch winters, frost, and snow,\\nand stormy weather, and you your duty to mind night and day--â\\x80\\x9d She made\\na little pause to get her breath, and smiled upon Colin, and went on\\nhastily, lest she should break down before all was said. â\\x80\\x9cIn the mony\\nhard winters that you have to look forward to--the lang life thatâ\\x80\\x99s to\\ncome--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, out of the darkness, â\\x80\\x9cdo you hear her saying\\nwhat she thinks is deception and falsehood. My mother is obliged to tell\\nme the doctorâ\\x80\\x99s lie; but it stumbles on her lips. That is not how she\\nwould speak of herself. She would say--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCallant, hold your peace,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. His voice was so harsh and\\nstrange, that it jarred in the air, and he rose up with a sudden\\nmovement, rising like a tower into the twilight, through which the\\npleasant reflections from the fire sparkled and played as lightly as if\\nthe talk had been all of pleasure. â\\x80\\x9cBe silent, sir,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfriend. â\\x80\\x9cHow dare you say to me that any word but truth can come out of\\nthe Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s lips? How dare ye--â\\x80\\x9d But here Lauderdale himself came to\\na sudden pause. He went to the window, as Colin had done, and then came\\nquickly back again. â\\x80\\x9cBecause weâ\\x80\\x99re a wee concerned and anxious about\\nhim, he thinks he may say what he likes,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with a\\nstrange, short laugh. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s the way with such callants. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re kings,\\nand give the laws to us that ken better. You may say what you like,\\nColin, but you must not name anything thatâ\\x80\\x99s no true with your motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nname.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt is strange to feel that you are going to die. It is stranger still to\\nsee your friends profoundly conscious of the awful news they have to\\nconvey, painfully making light of it, and trying to look as if they\\nmeant nothing. Colin perceived the signification of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s\\npathetic smiles, of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s impatience, of the vigilant watch they\\nkept upon him. He saw that, if perhaps her love kept a desperate spark\\nof hope alight in the Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s heart, it _was_ desperate, and she put\\nno confidence in it. All this he perceived, with the rapid and sudden\\nperception which comes at such a crisis. Perhaps for a moment the blood\\nwent back upon his heart with a suffocating sense of danger, against\\nwhich he could make no stand, and of an inevitable approaching fate\\nwhich he could not avoid or flee from. The next minute he laughed aloud.\\nThe sound of his laughter was strange and terrible to his companions.\\nThe Mistress took her boyâ\\x80\\x99s hand and caressed it, and spoke to him in\\nthe soothing words of his childhood. â\\x80\\x9cColin, my man--Colin, my bonnie\\nman!â\\x80\\x9d said the mother whose heart was breaking. She thought his laugh\\nsounded like defiance of God, defiance of the approaching doom; and such\\na fear was worse even than the dread of losing him. She kept his\\nreluctant fingers in hers, holding him fast to the faith and resignation\\nof his home. As for Lauderdale, he went away out of sight, struggling\\nwith a hard sob which all his strength could not restrain; and it was in\\nthe silence of this moment that Colinâ\\x80\\x99s laugh, more faintly, more\\nsoftly, with a playful sound that went to their hearts, echoed again\\ninto the room.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t hold me, mother,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cI could not run away from you if I\\nwould. You think I donâ\\x80\\x99t take my discovery as I ought to do? If it is\\ntrue,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, grasping his motherâ\\x80\\x99s hand, â\\x80\\x9cyou will have time\\nenough to be miserable about me after; let us be happy as long as we\\ncan. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it is true. I have died and come alive again. I\\nam not going to die any more just now,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a smile which\\nwas more than his mother could bear; and his eyes were so fixed upon\\nher, that her efforts to swallow the climbing sorrow in her throat were\\nsuch as consumed her strength. But even then it was of him and not\\nherself that she thought. â\\x80\\x9cI wasna meaning--I wasna saying--â\\x80\\x9d she tried\\nto articulate in her broken voice; and then at intervals, â\\x80\\x9cAâ\\x80\\x99 can be\\nborne--aâ\\x80\\x99 can be borne--that doesna go against the will of God. Oh\\nColin, my ain laddie! we maun aâ\\x80\\x99 die; but we must not rebel against\\nHim,â\\x80\\x9d cried the Mistress. A little more, and even she, though\\nlong-enduring as love could make her, must have reached the limits of\\nher strength; but Colin, strangely enough, was no way disposed for\\nsolemnity, nor for seriousness. He was at the height of the rebound,\\nand disposed to carry his nurses with him to that smiling mountain-top\\nfrom which death and sorrow had dispersed like so many mists and clouds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome to the window, and look out,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9ctake my arm, mother; it\\nfeels natural to have you on my arm. Look here--there are neither hills\\nnor water, but there are always stars about. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be\\ndiscouraged,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. He had to lean against the window to\\nsupport himself; but, all the same, he supported her, keeping fast hold\\nof the hand on his arm. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be discouraged,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnor to let you be discouraged. I have been in the valley of the shadow\\nof death, but I have come out again. It does not matter to me what the\\ndoctor says, or what Lauderdale says, or any other of my natural\\nenemies. You and I, mother, know better,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cI am not going to\\ndie.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two stood at the window, looking up to the faint stars, two faces\\ncast in the same mould--one distraught with a struggling of hope against\\nknowledge, against experience; the other radiant with a smile of youth.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not quite able to walk over the Alps, at present,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nleading the Mistress back to her chair; â\\x80\\x9cbut, for all that, let us go to\\nItaly since the doctor says so. And, Lauderdale, come out of the dark,\\nand light the candles, and donâ\\x80\\x99t talk any more nonsense. We are going to\\nhave a consultation about the ways and means. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it is to\\nbe done,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, gaily, â\\x80\\x9csince we have not a penny, nor has anybody\\nbelonging to us; but still, since you say so, mother, and the doctor,\\nand Lauderdale----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Mistress, all trembling and agitated, rose at this moment to help\\nLauderdale, who had come forward without saying anything, to do the\\npatientâ\\x80\\x99s bidding. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll no be angry?â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, under her\\nbreath; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 his spirits; he means nothing but love and kindness.â\\x80\\x9d\\nLauderdale met her eye with a countenance almost as much disturbed as\\nher own.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe angry?â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend; â\\x80\\x9che might have my head for a football,\\nif that would please him.â\\x80\\x9d The words were said in an undertone which\\nsounded like a suppressed growl; and as such Colin took this little\\nclandestine exchange of confidence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIs he grumbling, mother?â\\x80\\x9d said the object of their cares. â\\x80\\x9cNever mind;\\nhe likes to grumble. Now come to the fire, both of you, and talk. They\\nare oracles, these great doctors; they tell you what you are to do\\nwithout telling you how to do it. Must I go to Italy in a balloon?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin. â\\x80\\x9cAfter all, if it were possible, it would be worth being ill\\nfor,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with a sudden illumination in his eyes. He\\ntook the management of affairs into his own hands for the evening, and\\npointed out to them where they were to sit with the despotism of an\\ninvalid. â\\x80\\x9cNow we look comfortable,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cand are prepared to\\nlisten to suggestions. Lauderdale, your mind is speculative; do you\\nbegin.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was thus that Colin defeated the gathering dread and anguish which,\\neven in the face of his apparent recovery, closed more and more darkly\\nround him; and, as what he did and said did not arise from any set\\npurpose or conscious intention, but was a mere outburst of instinctive\\nfeeling, it had a certain inevitable effect upon his auditors, who\\nbrightened up, in spite of themselves and their convictions, under his\\ninfluence. When Colin laughed, instead of feeling inclined to sob or\\ngroan over him, even Lauderdale, after a while, cleared up too into a\\ndoubtful smile; and, as for the Mistress, her boyâ\\x80\\x99s confidence came to\\nher like a special revelation. She saw it was not assumed, and her heart\\nrose. â\\x80\\x9cWhen a young creatureâ\\x80\\x99s appointed to be taken, the Lord gives him\\nwarning,â\\x80\\x9d she said in secret; â\\x80\\x9cbut my Colin has nae message in himself,â\\x80\\x9d\\nand her tender soul was cheered by the visionary consolation. It was\\nunder the same exhilarating influence that Lauderdale spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve given up my situation,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cNo but what it was a very\\nhonourable situation, and no badly remunerated, but a man tires of\\neverything thatâ\\x80\\x99s aye the same day by day. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been working hard aâ\\x80\\x99 my\\nlife; and itâ\\x80\\x99s in the nature of man to be craving. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to Eetaly\\nfor my own hand,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cno on your account, callant. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nhad enough of the prose, and nowâ\\x80\\x99s the time for a bit poetry. No that I\\nundertake to write verses, like you. If he has not me to take care of\\nhim, heâ\\x80\\x99ll flee into print,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, reflectively. â\\x80\\x9cIt\\nwould be a terrible shock to me to see our first prizeman, the most\\ndistinguished student, as the Principal himself said, coming out in a\\nbook with lines to Eetaly, and verses about vineyards and oranges. That\\nkind of thing is aâ\\x80\\x99 very well for the callants at Oxford and Cambridge,\\nbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s something more expected from one of _us_,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m going to Eetaly, as I tell you, callant, as long as thereâ\\x80\\x99s a\\nglimmer of something like youth left in me, to get a bit poetry into my\\nlife. You and me will take our knapsacks on our backs and go off\\ntogether. I have a trifle in the bank; a hundred pounds--or maybe mair:\\nI couldnâ\\x80\\x99t say as to a shilling or two. If Iâ\\x80\\x99m speculative, as you say,\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m no without a turn for the practical,â\\x80\\x9d he continued with some pride;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand everythingâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 cheap when you know how to manage. This curate\\ncallant--he has not a great deal of sense, nor ony philosophical\\njudgment, that I can see; and, as for theology, he doesna understand\\nwhat it means; but he does not seem to me to be deficient in other\\norgans,â\\x80\\x9d said the impartial observer, â\\x80\\x9csuch as the heart, for example;\\nand heâ\\x80\\x99s been about the world, and understands about inns and things.\\nEvery living creature has its use in this life. I wouldna say he was\\ngood for very much in the way of direct teaching from the pulpit, but\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s been awfuâ\\x80\\x99 instructive to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you mean me to save my life at your cost?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThis is\\nwhat I have come to; at your cost or at my fatherâ\\x80\\x99s, or by somebodyâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncharity? No; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go home and sit in an easy-chair, like poor Hugh\\nCarlyle; and, mother, youâ\\x80\\x99ll take care----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen the sick manâ\\x80\\x99s fitful spirits thus yielded again his mother was\\nnear to soothe him into steadier courage. Again she held his hands, and\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cColin, my man--Colin, my bonnie man!â\\x80\\x9d with the voice of his\\nchildhood. â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll come back hale and strong to pay aâ\\x80\\x99body back the\\ntrouble,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, while Lauderdale proceeded unmoved, without\\nseeming to hear what Colin said.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re a mystery to me, thae English priests,â\\x80\\x9d said the meditative\\nScotchman. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re not to call ignorant, in the general sense, but\\ntheyâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 simple in their ways. To think of a man in possession of\\nhis faculties reading a verse or maybe a chapter out of the Bible, which\\nis very near as mysterious as life itself to the like of me, and then\\ndiscoursing about the Church and the Lessons appointed for this day or\\nthat. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a grand tether, that Prayer-Book, though. Yon kind of\\ncallant, so long as he keeps by that, heâ\\x80\\x99s safe in a kind of a way; but\\nhe knows nothing about whatâ\\x80\\x99s doing outside his printed walls, and, when\\nhe hears suddenly aâ\\x80\\x99 the stir thatâ\\x80\\x99s in the world, he loses his head,\\nand invents aâ\\x80\\x99 the old heresies over again. But heâ\\x80\\x99s awful instructive,\\nas I was saying, in the article of inns and steamboats. Not to say that\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s a grand Italian scholar, as far as I can understand, and reads\\nDante in the original. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful thought to realize the like of\\nthat innocent reading Dante. You and me, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a\\nsudden glow in his eyes, â\\x80\\x9cwill take the poets by the hand for once in\\nour lives. What you were saying about cost was a wonderful sensible\\nsaying for you. When the sillerâ\\x80\\x99s done weâ\\x80\\x99ll work our way home; itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\npity you have no voice to speak of, and I canna play the--guitar isâ\\x80\\x99t\\nthey call it?â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with a quaint grimace. He was\\ncontemptuous of the lighter arts, as was natural to his race and habits,\\nand once more Colinâ\\x80\\x99s laugh sounded gaily through the room, which, for\\nmany weeks, had known little laughter. They discussed the whole matter,\\nhalf playfully, half seriously, as they sat over the fire, growing eager\\nabout it as they went on. Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s hundred pounds â\\x80\\x9cor maybe mairâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwas the careful hoarding of years. He had saved it as poor Scotchmen are\\nreported to save, by minute economies, unsuspected by richer men. But he\\nwas ready to spend his little fortune with the composure of a\\nmillionaire. â\\x80\\x9cAnd myself after it, if that would make it more\\neffectual,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, as he went back in the darkness to his\\nlittle lodging in the village. Let it not be supposed, however, that any\\nidea of self-sacrifice was in the mind of Lauderdale. On the contrary,\\nhe contemplated this one possible magnificence of his life with a glow\\nof secret satisfaction and delight. He was willing to expend it all upon\\nColin, if not to save him, at least to please him. That was _his_\\npleasure, the highest gratification of which he was capable in the\\ncircumstances. He made his plans with the liberality of a prince,\\nwithout thinking twice about the matter--though it was all the wealth he\\nhad in the world which he was about to lavish freely for Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sake.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to take Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s money, but weâ\\x80\\x99ll arrange it somehow,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin; â\\x80\\x9cand then for the hard winters you speak of, mother, and the\\nlabour night and day.â\\x80\\x9d He sent her away with a smile; but, when he had\\nclosed the door of his own apartment, which now at length he was well\\nenough to have to himself without the attendance of any nurse, the light\\nwent out of the young manâ\\x80\\x99s face. After his kind attendants were both\\ngone, he sat down and began to think; things did not look so serene, so\\ncertain, so infallible when he was alone. He began to think, What if\\nafter all the doctor might be right? What if it were death and not life\\nthat was written against his name? The thought brought a little thrill\\nto Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and then he set himself to contemplate the\\npossibility. His faith was shadowy in details, like that of most people;\\nhis ideas about heaven had shifted and grown confused from the first\\nvague vision of beatitude, the crowns, and palms, and celestial harps of\\nchildhood. What was that other existence into which, in the fulness of\\nhis youth, he might be transported ere he was aware? _There_ at least\\nmust be the solution of all the difficulties that crazed the minds of\\nmen; _there_ at least, nearer to God, there must be increase of faculty,\\nelevation of soul. Colin looked it in the face, and the Unknown did not\\nappal him; but through the silence he seemed already to hear the cry of\\nanguish which would go up from one homely house under the unanswering\\nskies. It had been his home all his life: what would it be to him in the\\nevent of that change, which was death, but not destruction? Must he look\\ndown from afar off, from some cold, cruel distance, upon the sorrow of\\nhis friends, himself being happy beyond reach, bearing no share in the\\nburden? Or might he, according to a still more painful imagination, be\\nwith them, beside them, but unable by word or look, by breath or touch,\\nto lift aside even for a moment the awful veil, transparent to him, but\\nto them heavy and dark as night, which drops between the living and the\\ndead? It was when his thoughts came to this point, that Colin withdrew,\\nfaint and sick at heart, from the hopeless inquiry. He went to rest,\\nsaying his prayers as he said them at his motherâ\\x80\\x99s knee, for Jesusâ\\x80\\x99\\nsake. Heaven and earth swam in confused visions round the brain which\\nwas dizzy with the encounter of things too mysterious, too dark to be\\nfathomed. The only thing in Earth or Heaven of which there seemed to be\\nany certainty was the sole Existence which united both, in whose name\\nColin said his prayers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV.\\n\\n\\nMiss Matty Frankland all this time had not been without her trials. They\\nwere trials as unlike Colinâ\\x80\\x99s as possible, but not without some weight\\nand poignancy of their own, such as might naturally belong to the\\nsecondary heartaches of a woman who was far from being destitute either\\nof sense or feeling, and yet was at the same time a little woman of the\\nworld. In the first place, she was greatly aggravated that Harry, who on\\nthe whole seemed to be her fate, an inevitable necessity, should allow\\nhimself to be picked out of a canal at the hazard of another manâ\\x80\\x99s life.\\nHarry was, on the whole, a very good fellow, and was not apt to fall\\ninto an inferior place among his equals, or show himself less manful,\\ncourageous, or fortunate than other people. But it wounded Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s\\npride intensely to think that she might have to marry a man whose life\\nhad been twice saved, all the more as it was not a fault with which he\\ncould be reasonably upbraided. And then, being a woman, it was\\nimpossible for her to refrain from a little natural involuntary\\nhero-worship of the other; who was not only the hero of these\\nadventures, but her own chivalrous adorer to boot--perhaps the only man\\nin the world who had suffered his life to be seriously affected by her\\ninfluence. Not only so; but at bottom Miss Matty was fond of Colin, and\\nlooked upon him with an affectionate, caressing regard, which was not\\nlove, but might very easily have borne the aspect of love by moments,\\nespecially when its object was in a position of special interest.\\nBetween these two sentiments the young lady was kept in a state of\\nharass and worry, disadvantageous both to her looks and her temper--a\\nconsciousness of which re-acted in its turn upon her feelings. She put\\nit all down to Harryâ\\x80\\x99s score when, looking in her glass, she found\\nherself paler than usual. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder how he could be such an ass,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid to herself at such periods, with a form of expression unsuitable\\nfor a boudoir; and then her heart would melt towards his rival. There\\nwere even some moments in which she felt, or imagined she felt, the\\nthraldom of society, and uttered to herself sighs and sneers, half false\\nand half true, about the â\\x80\\x9cgilded chains,â\\x80\\x9d &c. which bound her to make\\nher appearance at Sir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s dinner-party, and to take an active part\\nin Lady Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s ball.\\n\\nAll this conflict of sentiment was conscious, which made matters worse:\\nfor all the time Matty was never quite clear of the idea that she was a\\nhumbug, and even in her truest impulse of feeling kept perpetually\\nfinding herself out. If Colin had been able to appear downstairs, her\\nposition would have been more and more embarrassing; as it was, she saw,\\nas clearly as any one, that the intercourse which she had hitherto kept\\nup with the tutor must absolutely come to an end now, when he had a\\nclaim so much stronger and more urgent upon the gratitude of the family.\\nAnd, the more closely she perceived this, the more did Matty grudge the\\nnecessity of throwing aside the most graceful of all her playthings.\\nThings might have gone on in the old way for long enough but for this\\nmost unnecessary and perplexing accident, which was entirely Harryâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfault. Now she dared not any longer play with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s devotion, and yet\\nwas very reluctant to give up the young worshipper, who amused and\\ninterested and affected her more than any other in her train. With this\\nin her mind, Miss Matty, as may be supposed, was a little fitful in her\\nspirits, and felt herself, on the whole, an injured woman. The ordinary\\nhomage of the drawing-room felt stale and unprofitable after Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\npoetic worship; and the wooing of Harry, who felt he had a right to her,\\nand conducted himself accordingly, made the contrast all the more\\ndistinct. And in her heart, deep down beyond all impulses of vanity,\\nthere lay a womanâ\\x80\\x99s pity for the sufferer, a womanâ\\x80\\x99s grateful but\\nremorseful admiration for the man who had given in exchange for all her\\nfalse coin a most unquestionable heart.\\n\\nIt will thus be apparent that Matty did not suspect the change that had\\ncome over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sentiments; perhaps she could not by any effort of her\\nunderstanding have realized the sudden revolution which these few weeks\\nhad worked in his mind. She would have been humbled, wounded, perhaps\\nangry, had she known of his disenchantment. But, in her ignorance, a\\ncertain yearning was in the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s mind. She was not reconciled to\\ngive him up; she wanted to see him again--even, so mingled were her\\nsentiments, to try her power upon him again, though it could only be to\\ngive him pain. Altogether, the business was complicated to an incredible\\nextent in the mind of Matty, and she had not an idea of the simple\\nmanner in which Colin had cut the knot and escaped out of all its\\nentanglements. When the accident was discussed downstairs the remarks of\\nthe general company were insufferable to the girl who knew more about\\nColin than any one else did; and the sharpness of her criticism upon\\ntheir talk confounded even Lady Frankland, whose powers of observation\\nwere not rapid. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear, you seem to be losing your temper,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nastonished aunt; and the idea gave Lady Frankland a little trouble. â\\x80\\x9cA\\nwoman who loses her temper will never do for Harry,â\\x80\\x9d she said in\\nconfidence to Sir Thomas. â\\x80\\x9cAnd, poor fellow, he is very ready to take\\noffence since this unfortunate accident. I am sure I am quite willing to\\nacknowledge how much we owe to Mr. Campbell; but it is very odd that\\nnothing has ever happened to Harry except in his company,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\naggrieved mother. Sir Thomas, for his part, was more reasonable.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA very lucky thing for Harry,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet. â\\x80\\x9cNobody else would\\nhave gone into that canal after him. I canâ\\x80\\x99t conceive how Harry could be\\nsuch a confounded ass,â\\x80\\x9d Sir Thomas added, with a mortified air. â\\x80\\x9cBut as\\nfor Campbell, poor fellow, anything that I can do for him--. By Jove,\\nMary, if he were to die I should never forgive myself.â\\x80\\x9d On the whole, it\\nwill be seen that the agitations occasioned by Colin were not confined\\nto his own chamber. As for Harry, he kept silence on the subject, but\\ndid not the less feel the inferior position in which his misfortune had\\nleft him. He was grateful so far, that, if he could have persuaded Colin\\nto accept any recompense, or done him any overwhelming favour, he would\\nhave gladly given that evidence of thankfulness. But, after the first\\nshock of horror with which he heard of the tutorâ\\x80\\x99s danger, it is certain\\nthat the mortification of feeling that his life had been saved at the\\nrisk of another manâ\\x80\\x99s life, produced in young Frankland anything but a\\nfriendly sentiment. To accept so vast an obligation requires an amount\\nof generosity of which Harry was not capable. The two young men were,\\nindeed, placed in this singular relationship to each other, without the\\nexistence of a spark of sympathy between them. Not only was the mind of\\nthe saved in a sore and resentful, rather than a grateful and\\naffectionate, state; but even the other, from whom more magnanimity\\nmight have been expected, had absolutely no pleasure in thinking that he\\nhad saved the life of a fellow-creature. That sweet satisfaction and\\napproval of conscience which is said to attend acts of benevolence did\\nnot make itself felt in the bosom of Colin. He was rather irritated than\\ngratified by the consciousness of having preserved Harry Frankland from\\na watery grave, as the apothecary said. The entire household was\\npossessed by sensations utterly unlike those which it ought to have felt\\nwhen, on the day succeeding his consultation with Lauderdale, Colin for\\nthe first time came down stairs. There were still some people in the\\nhouse giving full occupation to Lady Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s powers of hospitality,\\nand Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s of entertainment; but both the ladies heard in a minute or\\ntwo after his appearance that Mr. Campbell had been seen going into the\\nlibrary. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it would be best if you were to go and speak to him,\\nMatty,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cThere is no occasion for being too\\nenthusiastic; but you may say that I am very much occupied, or I would\\nhave come myself to welcome him. Say anything that is proper, my dear,\\nand I will try and induce Harry to go and shake hands, and make his\\nacknowledgments. Men have such a horror of making a fuss,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nperplexed mother. As for Matty, she went upon her errand with eagerness\\nand a little agitation. Colin was in the library, seated at the table\\nbeside Sir Thomas, when she went in. The light was shining full upon\\nhim, and it did not subdue the beatings of Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s contradictory little\\nheart to see how changed he was, and out of caves how deep those eyes\\nlooked which had taken new meanings unintelligible to her. She had\\nbeen, in her secret heart, a little proud of understanding Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes;\\nand it was humiliating to see the new significations which they had come\\nto during his sickness, and to which she had no clue. Sir Thomas was\\nspeaking when she came in; so Matty said nothing, but came and stood by\\nhim for a moment, and gave her hand to Colin. When their eyes met, they\\nwere both somewhat excited by it, though they were not in love with each\\nother; and then Matty drew a chair to the other side of the table, and\\nlooked remorsefully, pitifully, tenderly, on the man whom she supposed\\nher lover. She was surprised that he did not seek her eye, or show\\nhimself alive to all her movements, as he used to do; and at that\\nmoment, for the first time, it occurred to Matty to wonder whether the\\nabsolute possession of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart might not be worth a sacrifice. She\\nwas tired of Harry, and, to tell the truth, of most other people just\\nthen. And the sight of this youth--who was younger than she was, who was\\nso much more ignorant and less experienced than she, and who had not an\\nidea in his head about settlements and establishments, but entertained\\nvisions of an impossible life, with incomprehensible aims and meanings\\nin it,--had a wonderfully sudden effect upon her. For that instant Matty\\nwas violently tempted;--that is to say, she took it into consideration\\nas actually a question worth thinking of, whether it might not be\\npracticable to accept Colinâ\\x80\\x99s devotion, and push him on in the world,\\nand make something of him. She entertained the idea all the more,\\nstrangely enough, because she saw none of the old pleadings in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\neyes.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope you will never doubt our gratitude, Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand that the doctor has said you must not remain in this\\nclimate. Of course you must spend the spring in Nice, or somewhere. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncharming scenery thereabouts. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll get better directly you get into\\nthe air. And in summer, you know, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no place so good as\\nEngland--you must come back here. As for expenses, you shall have a\\ntravelling allowance over your salary. Donâ\\x80\\x99t say anything; money can\\nnever repay----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs long as I was Charleyâ\\x80\\x99s tutor,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cmoney was natural.\\nPardon me--I canâ\\x80\\x99t help the change of circumstances; there is no bond\\nbetween us now--only kindness,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man with an effort. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\nhave all been very good to me since I fell ill. I came to thank you, and\\nto say I must give up----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas; â\\x80\\x9cbut you canâ\\x80\\x99t imagine that I will let you\\nsuffer for your exertions on my sonâ\\x80\\x99s behalf, and for the regard you\\nhave shown to my family?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you would understand,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with vexation. â\\x80\\x9cI have\\nexplained to Lady Frankland more than once. It may seem rude to say so,\\nbut there was no regard for your family involved in that act, at least.\\nI was the only one of the party who saw that your son had gone down. I\\nhad no wish to go down after him--I canâ\\x80\\x99t say I had any impulse, even;\\nbut I had seen him, and I should have felt like his murderer if I had\\nnot attempted to save him. I am aware it is an ungracious thing to say,\\nbut I cannot accept praise which I donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, his\\nweakness bringing a hot sudden colour over his face; and then he stopped\\nshort, and looked at Sir Thomas, who was perplexed by this interruption,\\nand did not quite know how to shape his reply.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, well,â\\x80\\x9d said the baronet; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t exactly understand you, and I\\ndaresay you donâ\\x80\\x99t understand yourself. Most people that are capable of\\ndoing a brave action give queer explanations of it. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what you\\nmean, I suppose. No fellow thatâ\\x80\\x99s worth anything pretends to fine\\nmotives, and so forth. You did it because you could not help it. But\\nthat does not interfere with my gratitude. When you are ready to go, you\\nwill find a credit opened for you at my bankers, and we must see about\\nletters of introduction, and all that; and I advise you, if youâ\\x80\\x99re going\\nto Italy, to begin the language at once if you donâ\\x80\\x99t know it. Miss Matty\\nused to chatter enough for six when we were there. I daresay sheâ\\x80\\x99d like\\nnothing better than to teach you,â\\x80\\x9d said Sir Thomas. He was so much\\nrelieved by the possibility of turning over his difficult visitor upon\\nMatty, that he forgot the disadvantages of such a proposal. He got up,\\ndelighted to escape and to avoid any further remonstrance, and held out\\nhis hand to Colin. â\\x80\\x9cDelighted to see you downstairs again,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nbaronet; â\\x80\\x9cand I hope youâ\\x80\\x99ll bring your friend to dinner with you\\nto-night. Good-bye just now; I have, unfortunately, an engagement--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI will write to you all about it.â\\x80\\x9d And so the\\ngood-hearted Squire went away, thinking everything was settled. After\\nthat it was very strange for the two who had been so much together to\\nfind themselves again in the same room, and alone. As for Colin, he did\\nnot well know what to say. Almost the last time he had been by Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nside without any witnesses, was the time when he concluded that it was\\nonly his life that he was throwing away for her sake. Since that time\\nwhat a wonderful change had passed over him! The idea that he had\\nthought her smile, a glance of her eye, worth such a costly sacrifice,\\nannoyed Colin. But still her presence sent a little thrill through him\\nwhen they were left alone together. And, as for Miss Matty, there was\\nsome anxiety in her face as she looked at him. What did he mean? was he\\ntaking a desperate resolution to declare his sentiments? or what other\\nreason could there be for his unusual silence? for it never occurred to\\nher to attribute it to its true cause.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy uncle thinks you have consented to his plan,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty; â\\x80\\x9cbut I\\nsuppose I know what your face means better than he does. Why are you so\\nhard upon us, I wonder? I know well enough that Harry and you never took\\nto each other; but you used to like the rest of us--or, at least, I\\nthought so,â\\x80\\x9d said the little siren. She gave one of her pretty glances\\nat him under her eyelashes, and Colin looked at her across the table\\ncandidly, without any disguise. Alas! he had seen her throw that same\\nglance at various other persons, while he stood in the corner of the\\ndrawing-room observing everything; and the familiar artillery this time\\nhad no effect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have the greatest respect for everybody at Wodensbourne,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cyou did me only justice in thinking so. You have all been very good to\\nme.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not say anything about respect,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with pouting\\nlips. â\\x80\\x9cWe used to be friends, or, at least, I thought so. I never\\nimagined we were to break off into respect so suddenly. I am sure I wish\\nHarry had been a hundred miles away when he came to disturb us all,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the disarmed enchantress. She saw affairs were in the most critical\\nstate, and her words were so far true that she could have expressed her\\nfeelings best at that moment by an honest fit of crying. As this was\\nimpracticable, Miss Matty tried less urgent measures. â\\x80\\x9cWe have caused\\nyou nothing but suffering and vexation,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady, dropping\\nher voice and fixing her eyes upon the pattern of the table-cover, which\\nshe began to trace with her finger. â\\x80\\x9cI do not wonder that we have become\\ndisagreeable to you. But you should not condemn the innocent with the\\nguilty,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, looking suddenly up into his eyes. A touch of\\nagitation, the slightest possible, gave interest to the face on which\\nColin was looking; and perhaps all the time he had known her she had\\nnever so nearly approached being beautiful; as certainly, all the time,\\nshe had never so narrowly escaped being true. If things had been with\\nColin as they once were, the probability is that, moved by her emotion,\\nthe whole story of his love would have poured forth at this emergency;\\nand, had it done so, there is a possibility that Matty, carried away by\\nthe impulse of the moment, might have awoke next morning the affianced\\nwife of the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son of Ramore.\\n\\nProvidence, however, was kinder to the pair. Colin sat on the other side\\nof the table, and perceived that she was putting her little delicate\\nprobe into his wound. He thought he saw all the asides and stage\\ndirections, and looked at her with a curious, vicarious sense of shame.\\nColin, indeed, in his new enlightenment, was hard upon Matty. He thought\\nit was all because she would not give up her power over the victim, whom\\nshe intended only to torture, that she had thus taken the trouble to\\nre-open the ended intercourse. He could no more have believed that at\\nthis moment, while he was looking at her, such a thing was possible as\\nthat Matty might have accepted his love, and pledged her life to him,\\nthan he could have believed the wildest nonsense that was ever written\\nin a fairy tale. So the moments passed, while the ignorant mortal sat on\\nthe opposite side of the table--which was a very fortunate thing for\\nboth parties. Nevertheless, it was with a certain sense of contempt for\\nhim, as, after all, only an ordinary blind male creature, unconscious of\\nhis opportunities, mingled with a thrill of excitement, on her own part,\\nnatural to a woman who had just escaped a great danger, that Miss Matty\\nlistened to what Colin had to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is neither guilty nor innocent that I know of,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cyou\\nhave all been very kind to me. It is very good of you to take the pains\\nto understand me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to take advantage of Sir Thomas\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s kindness; but I am not such a churl as to fling it back in\\nhis teeth as if it was pride alone that made me refuse it. It is not\\npride alone,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, growing red, â\\x80\\x9cbut a sense of justice; for what\\nI have done has been done by accident. I will write and explain to Sir\\nThomas what I mean.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWrite and explain?â\\x80\\x9d said Matty. â\\x80\\x9cYou have twice said you would write.\\nDo you mean that you are going away?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAs soon as it is possible,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and then he perceived that he\\nwas speaking with rude distinctness. â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I have been taking\\nadvantage of your uncleâ\\x80\\x99s kindness too long. I have been a useless\\nmember of the household for six weeks at least. Yes, I must go away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou speak very calmly,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty. She was a little flushed, and\\nthere were tears in her eyes. If they had been real tears she would have\\nhidden them carefully, but as they were only half real she had no\\nobjection to let Colin see that she was concealing them. â\\x80\\x9cYou are very\\ncomposed about it, Mr. Campbell. One would think you were going away\\nfrom a place distasteful to you; or, at least, which you were totally\\nindifferent about. I daresay that is all very right and proper; but I\\nhave a good memory, and it appears rather strange to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was altogether a trying situation for Colin. If she had been able to\\nseduce him into a little recrimination she might have succeeded in\\ndragging the reluctant captive back again into her toils; which, having\\nby this time entirely recovered her senses, was all Miss Matty wanted.\\nHer downcast, tearful eyes, the faltering in her voice, were wonderfully\\npowerful weapons, which the young man was unable to combat by means of\\nmere indifference. Colin, however, being a man of impulses, was never to\\nbe calculated on beforehand for any particular line of conduct; and, on\\nthe present occasion, he entirely overleaped Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s bounds.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, it is strange,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps nothing but the sight of\\ndeath, who has been staring into my eyes for some time, could have shown\\nme the true state of affairs. I have uttered a great deal of nonsense\\nsince I came to Wodensbourne, and you--have listened to it, Miss\\nFrankland; and, perhaps, rather enjoyed seeing my tortures and my\\ndelights. But nothing could come of that; and when death hangs on behind\\neverything but love flies before him,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIt was pleasant\\nsport while it lasted; but everything, except love, comes to an end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcept love,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty. She was terribly piqued and mortified on\\nthe surface, and a little humbled and sorrowful within. She had a sense,\\ntoo, that, for one moment, at the beginning of this interview, she had\\nalmost been capable of that sentiment which Colin exalted so highly: and\\nthat, consequently, he did her injustice in speaking of it as something\\nwith which she had nothing to do. â\\x80\\x9cI remember hearing you talk of _that_\\nsometimes, in the midst of what you call nonsense now. If you did not\\nunderstand yourself, you canâ\\x80\\x99t expect that I should have understood\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d she went on. To tell the truth, Miss Matty was very near crying.\\nShe had experienced the usual injustice of human affairs, and been\\npunished for her vanity just at the moment when she was inclined to do\\nbetter; and her heart cried out against such cruel usage. This time,\\nhowever, she kept her tears quite in subjection and did not show them,\\nbut only repeated, â\\x80\\x9cYou could not expect that I should understand you,\\nif you did not understand yourself!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; that is true at least,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with eyes that strayed beyond\\nher, and had gone off into other regions unknown to Matty. This which\\nhad piqued her even at the height of their alliance gave her an excuse\\nfor her anger now.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd when you go off into sentiment I never understand you,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung lady. â\\x80\\x9cI will _levo lâ\\x80\\x99incomodo_, as the Italians say. That shall\\nbe your first lesson in the language which my uncle says I am to teach\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d and she turned away with a glance half-spiteful, half-wistful,\\nwhich had more effect upon Colin than a world of words. He got up to\\nopen the door for her, weak as he was, and took her hand and kissed it\\nas she went away. Then Colin took himself laboriously upstairs, having\\ndone his dayâ\\x80\\x99s work. And so unreasonable was the young man, that Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlast glance filled his heart with gentler thoughts of the world in\\ngeneral, though he was not in love any longer. â\\x80\\x9cI was not such a fool\\nafter all,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself; which was a great consolation. As for\\nMatty, she cried heartily when she got to her room, and felt as if she\\nhad lost something. Nor did she recover until after luncheon, when some\\npeople came to call, and it was her duty to be entertaining, and relieve\\nLady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cI hope you said everything that was proper to Mr.\\nCampbell, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady of the house when lunch was over. And\\nso that chapter came to an end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV.\\n\\n\\nAfter this interview it was strange to meet again the little committee\\nupstairs, and resume the consideration of ways and means, which Sir\\nThomas would have settled so summarily. Colin could not help thinking of\\nthe difference with a little amusement. He was young enough to be able\\nto dismiss entirely the grave thoughts of the previous night, feeling in\\nhis elastic, youthful mind, something of the fresh influence of the\\nmorning, or at least--for Colin had found out that the wind was\\neasterly, a thing totally indifferent to him in old times--of the\\nsentiment of the morning, which, so long as heart and courage are\\nunbroken, renews the thoughts and hopes. Money was a necessary evil, to\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s thinking. So long as there happened to be enough of it for\\nnecessary purposes, he was capable of laughing at the contrast between\\nhis own utter impecuniosity and the wealth which was only important for\\nsake of the things that could be done with it. Though he was Scotch, and\\nof a careful, money-making race, this was as yet the aspect which money\\nbore to the young man. He laughed as he leaned back in his easy chair.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat Lauderdale makes up by working for years, and what we canâ\\x80\\x99t make\\nup by any amount of working, Sir Thomas does with a scrape of his pen,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin. â\\x80\\x9cDownstairs they need to take little thought about these\\nmatters, and up here a great deal of thought serves very little purpose.\\nOn the whole, it seems to me that it would be very good for our tempers\\nand for our minds in general if we all had plenty of money,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung philosopher, still laughing. He was tolerably indifferent on the\\nsubject, and able to take it easily. While he spoke, his eye lighted on\\nhis motherâ\\x80\\x99s face, who was not regarding the matter by any means so\\nlightly. Mrs. Campbell on the contrary was suffering under one of the\\ngreatest minor trials of a woman. She thought her sonâ\\x80\\x99s life depended on\\nthis going to Italy, and to procure the means for it there was nothing\\non earth his mother would not have done. She would have undertaken\\njoyfully the rudest and hardest labour that ever was undertaken by man.\\nShe would have put her hands, which indeed were not unaccustomed to\\nwork, to any kind of toil; but with this eager, longing in her heart she\\nknew at the same time that it was quite impossible for her to do\\nanything by which she could earn those sacred and precious coins on\\nwhich her boyâ\\x80\\x99s life depended. While Colin spoke, his mother was making\\npainful calculations what she could save and spare, at least, if she\\ncould not earn. Colin stopped short when he looked at her; he could not\\nlaugh any longer. What was to him a matter of amusing speculation was to\\nher life or death.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere canna but be inequalities in this world,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, her\\ntender brows still puckered with their baffling calculations. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nenvious of ony grandeur, nor of taking my ease, nor of the pleasures of\\nthis life. Weâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 happy at hame in our smaâ\\x80\\x99 way when aâ\\x80\\x99s weel with\\nthe bairns; but itâ\\x80\\x99s for their sakes, to get them aâ\\x80\\x99 thatâ\\x80\\x99s good for\\nthem! Moneyâ\\x80\\x99s precious when it means health and life,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs.\\nCampbell, with a sigh; â\\x80\\x9cand itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard upon a woman when she can do\\nnothing for her ain, and them in need.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve known it hard upon mony a man,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s little\\ndifference when it comes to that. But a hundred pounds,â\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\nwith a delightful consciousness of power and magnificence, â\\x80\\x9cis not a bad\\nsum to begin upon; before thatâ\\x80\\x99s done, there will be time to think of\\nmore. Itâ\\x80\\x99s none of your business, callant, that I can see. If youâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\ncome with me, you must even stay behind. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve set my heart on a holiday.\\nA man has little good of his existence when he does nothing but work and\\neat, and eat and work again, as Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been doing. I would like to take\\nthe play a while, and feel that Iâ\\x80\\x99m alive.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen the Mistress saw how Lauderdale stretched his long limbs on his\\nchair, and how Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face brightened with the look, half sympathetic,\\nhalf provocative, which usually marked the beginning of a long\\ndiscussion, she went to the other end of the room for her work. It was\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s linen which his mother was putting in order, and she was rather\\nglad to withdraw to a distance, and retire within that refuge of\\nneedlework, which is a kind of sanctuary for a woman, and in which she\\ncould pursue undisturbed her own thoughts. After a while, though these\\ndiscussions were much in Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s way, and she was not\\ndisinclined in general to take part in them, she lost the thread of the\\nconversation. The voices came to her in a kind of murmur, now and then\\nchiming in with a chance word or two in the current of her own\\nreflections. The atmosphere which surrounded the convalescent had never\\nfelt so hopeful as to-day, and the heart of the mother swelled with a\\nsense of restoration, a trust in Godâ\\x80\\x99s mercy which recently had been\\ndull and faint within her. Restoration, recovery, deliverance--Nature\\ngrows humble, tender, and sweet under these influences of heaven. The\\nMistressâ\\x80\\x99s heart melted within her, repenting of all the hard thoughts\\nshe had been thinking, of all the complaints she had uttered. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\ngood for me that I was afflicted,â\\x80\\x9d said the Psalmist; but it was not\\nuntil his affliction was past that he could say so. Anguish and loss\\nmake no such confession. The heart, when it is breaking, has enough ado\\nto refrain from accusing God of its misery, and it is only the\\ninhumanity of human advisers that adjure it to make spiritual\\nmerchandize out of the hopelessness of its pain.\\n\\nMatters were going on thus in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s chamber, where he and his friend\\nsat talking; and the mother at the other end of the room carefully\\nsewing on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s buttons, began to descend out of her heaven of\\nthankfulness, and to be troubled with a pang of apprehension lest her\\nhusband should not see things in the same light as she did, but might,\\nperhaps, demur to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s journey as an unwarrantable expense. People at\\nRamore did not seek such desperate remedies for failing health. Whenever\\na cherished one was ill, they were content to get â\\x80\\x9cthe best doctors,â\\x80\\x9d\\nand do everything for him that household care and pains could do; but,\\nfailing that, the invalid succumbed into the easy chair, and, when\\ndomestic cherishing would serve the purpose no longer, into a submissive\\ngrave, without dreaming of those resources of the rich which might still\\nhave prolonged the fading life. Colin of Ramore was a kind father, but\\nhe was only a man, as the Mistress recollected, and apt to come to\\ndifferent conclusions from an anxious and trembling mother. Possibly he\\nmight think this great expense unnecessary, not to be thought of, an\\ninjustice to his other children; and the thought disturbed her\\nreflections terribly, as she sat behind backs examining Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwardrobe. At all events, present duty prompted her to make everything\\nsound and comfortable, that he might be ready to encounter the journey\\nwithout any difficulty on that score; and, absorbed in these mingled\\ncares and labours, she was folding up carefully the garments she had\\ndone with, and laying them before her in a snowy heap upon the table,\\nwhen the curate knocked softly at the door. It was rather an odd scene\\nfor the young clergyman, who grew more and more puzzled by his Scotch\\nacquaintances the more he saw of them, not knowing how to account for\\ntheir quaint mixture of homeliness and intelligence, nor whether to\\naddress them politely as equals, or familiarly as inferiors. Mrs.\\nCampbell came forward, when he opened the door, with her cordial smile\\nand looks as gracious as if she had been a duchess. â\\x80\\x9cCome away, sir,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife; â\\x80\\x9cwe are aye real glad to see you,â\\x80\\x9d and then the\\nMistress stopped short, for Henry Frankland was behind the curate, and\\nsomehow the heir of Wodensbourne was not a favourite with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmother. But her discontent lasted only a moment. â\\x80\\x9cI canna bid ye\\nwelcome, Mr. Frankland, to your own house,â\\x80\\x9d said the diplomatical woman;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut if it was mine I would say I was glad to see you.â\\x80\\x9d This was how she\\ngot over the difficulty. But she followed the two young men towards the\\nfire, where Colin had risen from his easy chair. She could but judge\\naccording to her knowledge, like other people; and she was a little\\nafraid that the man who had taken his love from him, who had hazarded\\nhis health and, probably, his life, would find little favour in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\neyes; and to be anything but courteous to a man who came to pay her a\\nvisit, even had he been her greatest enemy, was repugnant to her\\nbarbaric-princely Scotch ideas. She followed accordingly, to be at hand\\nand put things straight, if they went wrong.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFrankland was too late to see you to-day when you were downstairs; so\\nhe thought he would come up with me,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate, giving this\\ngraceful version of the fact that, dragged by himself and pursued by\\nLady Frankland, Harry had most reluctantly ascended the stair. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\nvery glad indeed to hear that you were down to-day. You are\\nlooking--ah--better already,â\\x80\\x9d said the kind young man. As for Harry\\nFrankland, he came forward and offered his hand, putting down at the\\nsame time on the table a pile of books with which he was loaded.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy cousin told me you wanted to learn Italian,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry; â\\x80\\x9cso I\\nbrought you the books. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a very easy language; though people talk\\ngreat nonsense about its being musical. It is not a bit sweeter than\\nEnglish. If you only go to Nice, French will answer quite well.â\\x80\\x9d He sat\\ndown suddenly and uncomfortably as he delivered himself of this\\nutterance; and Colin, for his part, took up the grammar, and looked at\\nit as if he had no other interest under the sun.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t agree with Frankland there,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate; â\\x80\\x9ceverything is\\nharmonious in Italy except the churches. I know you are a keen observer,\\nand I am sure you will be struck with the fine spirit of devotion in the\\npeople; but the churches are the most impious edifices in existence,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the Anglican, with warmth--which was said, not because the curate\\nwas thinking of ecclesiastical art at the moment, but by way of making\\nconversation, and conducting the interview between the saved man and his\\ndeliverer comfortably to an end.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you said you had never been in Scotland?â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cFor\\nmy part Iâ\\x80\\x99m no heeding much about the churches; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m curious to see\\nthe workings of an irrational system where it has no limit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 interesting subject of inquiry; and there is little doubt in my\\nmind that a real popular system must aye be more or less irrational----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said the curate. â\\x80\\x9cOf course there are many errors\\nin the Church of Rome; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that such a word as\\nirrational----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a very good word,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no using it in a\\ncontemptuous sense. Manâ\\x80\\x99s an irrational being, take him at his best. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nnot saying if itâ\\x80\\x99s above reason or below reason, but out of reason;\\nwhich makes it none the worse to me. All religionâ\\x80\\x99s out of reason for\\nthat matter--which is a thing we never can be got to allow in Scotland.\\nYou understand it better here,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher; but the curateâ\\x80\\x99s\\nattention was too much distracted to leave him any time for\\nself-defence.\\n\\nDuring this pause, however, Colin and Harry were eyeing each other over\\nthe Italian books. â\\x80\\x9cYou wonâ\\x80\\x99t find it at all difficult,â\\x80\\x9d said young\\nFrankland; â\\x80\\x9cif you had been staying longer we might have helped you. I\\nsay--look here; I am much obliged to you,â\\x80\\x9d Harry added suddenly: â\\x80\\x9ca\\nfellow does not know what to say in such circumstances. I am horribly\\nvexed to think of your being ill. Iâ\\x80\\x99d be very glad to do as much for you\\nas you have done for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich is simply nothing at all,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, hastily; and then he\\nbecame conscious of the effort the other had made. â\\x80\\x9cThank you for saying\\nso much. I wish you could, and then nobody would think any more about\\nit,â\\x80\\x9d he said, laughing; and they regarded each other for another half\\nminute across the table while Lauderdale and the curate kept on talking\\nheresy. Then Colin suddenly held out his hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt seems my fate to go away without a grudge against anybody,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung man; â\\x80\\x9cwhich is hard enough when one has a certain right to a\\ngrievance. Good-bye. I daresay after this your path and mine will\\nscarcely cross again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,â\\x80\\x9d said Harry Frankland, rising up--and he made a step or two\\nto the door, but came back again, swallowing a lump in his throat.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, holding out his hand another time. â\\x80\\x9cI hope\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99ll soon get well! God bless you, old fellow! I never knew you till\\nnow;â\\x80\\x9d and so disappeared very suddenly, closing the door after him with\\na little unconscious violence. Colin lay back in his chair with a smile\\non his face. The two who were talking beside him had their ears intently\\nopen to this bye-play, but they went on with their talk, and left the\\nprincipal actors in the little drama alone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder if I am going to die?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, softly, to himself; and\\nthen he caught the glance of terror, almost of anger, with which his\\nmother stopped short and looked at him, with her lips apart, as if her\\nbreathing had stopped for the moment. â\\x80\\x9cMother, dear, I have no such\\nintention,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man; â\\x80\\x9conly that I am leaving Wodensbourne\\nwith feelings so amicable and amiable to everybody, that it looks\\nalarming. Even Harry Frankland, you see--and this morning his\\ncousin----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat about his cousin, Colin?â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, with bated breath.\\n\\nUpon which Colin laughed--not harshly or in mockery--softly, with a\\nsound of tenderness, as if somewhere not far off there lay a certain\\nfountain of tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is very pretty, mother,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cvery sweet, and kind, and\\ncharming. I daresay she will be a leader of fashion a few years hence,\\nwhen she is married; and I shall have great pleasure in paying my\\nrespects to her when I go up from the Assembly in black silk stockings,\\nwith a deputation, to present an address to the Queen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Campbell never heard any more of what had been or had not been\\nbetween her son and the little siren whom she herself, in the bitterness\\nof her heart, had taken upon herself to reprove; and this was how Colin,\\nwithout, as he said, a grudge against anybody, concluded the episode of\\nWodensbourne.\\n\\nSome time, however, elapsed before it was possible for Colin and his\\ncompanion to leave England. Colin of Ramore was, as his wife had\\nimagined, slow to perceive the necessity for so expensive a proceeding.\\nThe fatherâ\\x80\\x99s alarm by this time had come to a conclusion. The favourable\\nbulletins which the Mistress had sent from time to time by way of\\ncalming the anxiety of the family, had appeared to the farmer the\\nnatural indications of a complete recovery; and so thought Archie, who\\nwas his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s chief adviser in the absence of the mistress of the\\nhouse.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe wifeâ\\x80\\x99s gone crazy,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin. â\\x80\\x9cShe thinks this laddie of hers\\nshould be humoured and made of as if he was Sir Thomas Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s son.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd the farmer treated with a little carelessness his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s assurances\\nthat a warmer climate was necessary for Colin.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNaebody would ever have thought of such a thing had he been at hame\\nwhen the accident happened,â\\x80\\x9d said Archie; which was, indeed, very true:\\nand the father and son, who were the money-makers of the family, thought\\nthe idea altogether fantastical. The matter came to be mentioned to the\\nminister, who was, like everybody else on the Holy Loch, interested\\nabout Colin, and, as it happened, finally reached the ears of the same\\nProfessor who had urged him to compete for the Baliol scholarship. Now,\\nit would be hard in this age of competitive examinations to say anything\\nin praise of a university prize awarded by favour--not to say that the\\nprizes in Scotch universities are so few as to make such patronage\\nspecially invidious. Matters are differently managed now-a-days, and it\\nis to be hoped that pure merit always wins the tiny rewards which\\nScotch learning has at its disposal; but in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s day the interest of\\na popular professor was worth something. The little conclave was again\\ngathered round the fire in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s room at Wodensbourne, reading, with\\nmingled feelings, a letter from Ramore, when another communication from\\nGlasgow was put into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s hand. The farmerâ\\x80\\x99s letter had been a little\\nimpatient, and showed a household disarranged and out of temper. One of\\nthe cows was ill, and the maid-servant of the period had not proved\\nherself equal to the emergency. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to hurry you, or to make\\nColin move before he is able,â\\x80\\x9d wrote the head of the house; â\\x80\\x9cbut it\\nappears to me that he would be far more likely to recover his health and\\nstrength at home.â\\x80\\x9d The Mistress had turned aside, apparently to look out\\nat the window, from which was visible a white blast of rain sweeping\\nover the dreary plain which surrounded Wodensbourne, though in reality\\nit was to hide the gush of tears that had come to her eyes. Big Colin\\nand his wife were what people call â\\x80\\x9ca very united couple,â\\x80\\x9d and had kept\\nthe love of their youth wonderfully fresh in their hearts; but still\\nthere were times when the man was impatient and dull of understanding,\\nand could not comprehend the woman, just as, perhaps, though Mrs.\\nCampbell was not so clearly aware of that side of the question, there\\nmight be times when, on her side, the woman was equally a hindrance to\\nthe man. She looked out upon the sweeping rain, and thought of the â\\x80\\x9csoft\\nweatherâ\\x80\\x9d on the Holy Loch, which had so depressing an effect upon\\nherself, notwithstanding her sound health and many duties, and of the\\nwinds of March which were approaching, and of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s life,--the most\\nprecious thing on earth, because the most in peril. What was she to do,\\na poor woman who had nothing, who could earn nothing, who had only\\nuseless yearnings and cares of love to give her son?\\n\\nWhile Mrs. Campbell was thus contemplating her impotence, and wringing\\nher hands in secret over the adverse decision from home, Lauderdale was\\nwalking about the room in a state of high good-humour and content,\\nradiant with the consciousness of that hundred pounds, â\\x80\\x9cor maybe mair,â\\x80\\x9d\\nwith which it was to be his unshared, exclusive privilege to succour\\nColin. â\\x80\\x9cI see no reason why we should wait longer. The Mistress is\\nwanted at home, and the east winds are coming on; and, when our siller\\nis spent weâ\\x80\\x99ll make more,â\\x80\\x9d said the exultant philosopher. And it was at\\nthis moment of all others that the professorâ\\x80\\x99s letter was put into the\\ninvalidâ\\x80\\x99s hands. He read it in silence, while the Mistress remained at\\nthe window, concocting in her mind another appeal to her husband, and\\nwondering in her tender heart how it was that men were so dull of\\ncomprehension and so hard to manage. â\\x80\\x9cIf Colin should turn ill\\nagainâ\\x80\\x9d--for she dared not even think the word she meant--â\\x80\\x9chis father\\nwould never forgive himselâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress to herself; and, as for\\nLauderdale, he had returned to the contemplation of a Continental\\nBradshaw, which was all the literature of which at this crisis Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfriend was capable. They were both surprised when Colin rose up, flushed\\nand excited, with this letter which nobody had attached any importance\\nto in his hands. â\\x80\\x9cThey have given me one of the new scholarships,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin without any preface, â\\x80\\x9cto travel and complete my studies. It is a\\nhundred pounds a year; and I think, as Lauderdale says, we can start\\nto-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, who in his weakness and excitement was\\nmoved almost to tears.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, the Lord bless them!â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, sitting down\\nsuddenly in the nearest chair. She did not know who it was upon whom she\\nwas bestowing that benediction, which came from the depths of her heart;\\nbut she had to sit still after she had uttered it, blinded by two great\\ntears that made even her sonâ\\x80\\x99s face invisible, and with a trembling in\\nher frame, which rendered her incapable of any movement. She was\\ninconsistent, like other human creatures. When she had attained to this\\nsudden deliverance, and had thanked God for it, it instantly darted\\nthrough her mind that her boy was going to leave her on a solemn and\\ndoubtful journey, now to be delayed no longer; and it was some time\\nbefore she was able to get up and arrange for the last time the\\ncarefully-mended linen, which was all ready for him now. She packed it,\\nshedding a few tears over it, and saying prayers in her tender heart for\\nher firstborn; and God only knows the difficulty with which she\\npreserved her smile and cheerful looks, and the sinking of her heart\\nwhen all her arrangements were completed. Would he ever come back again\\nto make her glad? â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll take awfuâ\\x80\\x99 care of my laddie?â\\x80\\x9d she said to\\nLauderdale, who, for his part, was not delighted with the scholarship;\\nand that misanthrope answered, â\\x80\\x9cAy, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take care of him.â\\x80\\x9d This was all\\nthat passed between the two guardians, who knew, in their inmost hearts,\\nthat the object of their care might never come back again. All the\\nhousehold of Wodensbourne turned out to wish Colin a good journey next\\nmorning when he went away; and the Mistress put down her old-fashioned\\nveil when the express was gone which carried him to London, and went\\nhome again humbly by the night-train. Fortunately there was in the same\\ncarriage with her a harassed young mother with little children, whose\\nnecessities speedily demanded the lifting up of Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s veil.\\nAnd the day was clear on the Holy Loch, and all her native hills held\\nout their arms to her, when the good woman reached her home. She was\\nable to see the sick cows that afternoon, and her experience suggested a\\nmeans of relieving the speechless creatures which filled the house with\\nadmiration. â\\x80\\x9cShe may be a foolish woman about her bairns,â\\x80\\x9d said big\\nColin, who was half pleased and half angry to hear her story; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s\\na different-looking house when the wife comes hame.â\\x80\\x9d And thus the\\nnatural sunshine came back again to the Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI.\\n\\n\\nColin and his guardian went on their way in a direction opposite to that\\nin which the Mistress travelled sadly alone. They made all the haste\\npossible out of the cold and boisterous weather, to get to sea; which\\nwas at once, according to all their hopes, to bring health to the\\ninvalid. Lauderdale, who carried his little fortune about him, had been\\nat great pains in dispersing it over his person; so that, in case of\\nfalling among thieves--which, to a man venturing into foreign parts for\\nthe first time, seemed but too probable--he might, at least, have a\\nchance of saving some portion of his store. But he was not prepared for\\nthe dire and dreadful malady which seized him unawares, and made him\\nequally incapable of taking care of his money and of taking care of\\nColin. He could not even make out how many days he had lain helpless and\\nuseless in what was called the second cabin of the steamer--where the\\narrangements and the provisions were less luxurious than in the more\\nexpensive quarters. But Lauderdale, under the circumstances, did not\\nbelieve in comfort; he gave it up as a thing impossible. He fell into a\\nstate of utter scepticism as he lay in agonies of sea-sickness on the\\nshelf which represented a bed. â\\x80\\x9cSay nothing to me about getting there,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said, with as much indignation as he was capable of. â\\x80\\x9cWhat do you\\nmean by _there_, callant? As for land, Iâ\\x80\\x99m far from sure that thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsuch a thing in existence. If there is, weâ\\x80\\x99ll never get to it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an\\nawful thing for a man in his senses to deliver himself up to this idiot\\nof a sea, to be played with like a bairnâ\\x80\\x99s ball. Itâ\\x80\\x99s very easy to\\nlaugh; if you had been standing on your head, like me, for twenty days\\nin succession--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly four days,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, laughing, â\\x80\\x9cand the gale is over. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll be\\nbetter to-morrow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow!â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a contemptuous groan; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve no faith\\nin to-morrow. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no equal to reckoning time according to ordinary\\nmethods, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no conscious of ever having existed in a more agreeable\\nposition. As for the chances of ever coming head uppermost again, I\\nwould not give sixpence for them. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all very well for the like of\\nyou. Let me alone, callant; if this infernal machine of a ship would but\\ngo down without more ado, and leave a man in peace--thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\npleasantest thing I can think of. Donâ\\x80\\x99t speak to me about Italy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nall a snare and delusion to get honest folk off firm ground. Let me get\\nto the bottom in peace and quiet. Lifeâ\\x80\\x99s no worth having at such a\\nprice,â\\x80\\x9d sighed the sufferer; to whom his undutiful charge answered only\\nby laughter and jibes, which, under the circumstances, were hard to\\nbear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are better now,â\\x80\\x9d said the heartless youth, â\\x80\\x9cor you could not go\\ninto the philosophy of the subject. To-morrow morning youâ\\x80\\x99ll eat a good\\nbreakfast, and--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDinna insult my understanding,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s victim. â\\x80\\x9cGo away, and look\\nout for your Italy, or whatever you call it. A callant like you believes\\nin everything. Go away and enjoy yourself. If you donâ\\x80\\x99t go peaceably,\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll put you out,â\\x80\\x9d cried the miserable man, lifting himself up from his\\npillow, and seizing a book which Colin had laid there, to throw at his\\ntormentor. A sudden lurch, however, made an end of the discomfited\\nphilosopher. He fell back, groaning, as Colin escaped out of the little\\ncabin. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s quite intolerable, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no put up with it any longer,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lauderdale to himself. And he recalled, with a sense of injury,\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s freedom from the overpowering malady under which he was himself\\nsuffering. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s me thatâ\\x80\\x99s ill, and no him,â\\x80\\x9d he thought, with surprise,\\nand the thought prevailed even over sea-sickness. By-and-by it warmed\\nwith a delicious glow of hope and consolation the heart of the sufferer.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it sets the callant right, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no heeding for myself,â\\x80\\x9d he said in\\nhis own mind, with renewed heroism. Perhaps it was because, as Colin\\nsaid, Lauderdale was already beginning to be better that he was capable\\nof such generosity. Certainly the ship lurched less and less as the\\nevening went on, and the moonlight stole in at the port-hole and\\ncaressed the sufferer, widening his horizon a little before he was\\naware. He had begun to wonder whether Colin had his great coat on before\\nlong, and fell asleep in that thought, and worked out his remaining\\nspell of misery in gigantic efforts--continued all through the night--to\\nget into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s coat, or to get Colin into his coat, he was not quite\\nsure which. Meanwhile, the object of Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s cares was on deck,\\nenjoying the moonlight, and the sense of improving health, and all the\\nexcitement and novelty of his new life.\\n\\nThey had been four days at sea, and Colin, who had not been ill, had\\nbecome acquainted with the aspect of all his fellow passengers who were\\nas good sailors as himself. They were going to Leghorn, as the easiest\\nway of reaching Italy; and there were several invalids on board, though\\nnone whose means made necessary a passage in the second cabin, of which\\nColin himself and Lauderdale were the sole occupants. Of the few groups\\non the quarter-deck who were able to face the gale, Colin had already\\ndistinguished one, a young man, a little older than himself, exceedingly\\npale and worn with illness, accompanied by a girl a year or two younger.\\nThe two were so like each other as to leave no doubt that they must be\\nbrother and sister, and so unlike as to call forth the compassionate\\nobservation of everybody who looked at them. The young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s blooming\\nface, delicately round and full, with the perfect outline of health and\\nyouth, had been paled at first by the struggle between incipient\\nsea-sickness and the determination not to leave her brother; but by this\\ntime--at the cost of whatever private agonies--she had apparently\\nsurmounted the common weakness, and was throwing into fuller and fuller\\ncertainty, without knowing it, by the contrast of her own bloom, the\\nsentence of death written on his face. When they were on deck, which was\\nthe only time that they were visible to Colin, she never left him;\\nholding fast by his arm with an anxious tenacity, not receiving, but\\ngiving support; and watching him with incessant, breathless anxiety, as\\nif afraid that he might suddenly drop away from her side. The brother,\\nfor his part, had those hollow eyes, set in wide pathetic niches, which\\nare never to be mistaken by those who have once watched beloved eyes\\nwidening out into that terrible breadth and calm. He was as pale as if\\nthe warm blood of life had already been wrung out of him drop by drop;\\nbut, notwithstanding this aspect of death, he was still possessed by a\\nkind of feverish activity, the remains of strength, and seemed less\\ndisturbed by the gale than any other passenger. He was on deck at all\\nhours, holding conversations with such of the sailors as he could get\\nat--talking to the captain, who seemed to eschew his society, and to\\nsuch of his fellow-travellers as were visible there.\\n\\nWhat the subject of this sick travellerâ\\x80\\x99s talk might be, Colin from his\\npoint of observation could not tell; but there was no mistaking the\\nevidences of natural eloquence and the eagerness of the speaker. â\\x80\\x9cHe\\nought to be a preacher by his looks,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said to himself, as he stood\\nwithin the limits to which, as a second-class passenger, he was\\nconfined, and saw at a little distance from him, the worn figure of the\\nsick man, upon whose face the moonlight was shining. As usual, the\\nsister was clinging to his arm and listening to him with a rapt\\ncountenance; not so much concerned about what he said, it seemed, as\\nabsorbed in anxious investigation of his looks. It was one of the\\nsailors this time who formed the audience which the invalid addressed--a\\nman whom he had stopped in the midst of something he was doing, and who\\nwas listening with great evident embarrassment, anxious to escape, but\\nmore anxious still, like a good-hearted fellow as he was, not to disturb\\nor irritate the suffering man. Colin drew a step nearer, feeling that\\nthe matter under discussion could be no private one, and the sound of\\nthe little advance he made caught the invalidâ\\x80\\x99s nervous ear. He turned\\nround upon Colin before he could go back, and suddenly fixed him with\\nthose wonderful dying eyes. â\\x80\\x9cI shall see you again another time, my\\nfriend,â\\x80\\x9d he said to the released seaman, who hastened off with an\\nevident sense of having escaped. When the stranger turned round he had\\nto move back his companion, so that in the change of position she came\\nto be exactly in front of Colin, so near that the two could not help\\nseeing, could not help observing each other. The girl withdrew her eyes\\na moment from her brother to look at the new face thus presented to her.\\nShe did not look at Colin as a young woman usually looks at a young man.\\nShe was neither indifferent, nor did she attempt to seem so. She looked\\nat him eagerly, with a question in her eyes. The question was a strange\\none to be addressed, even from the eyes, by one stranger to another. It\\nsaid as plain as words, â\\x80\\x9cAre you a man to whom I can appeal--are you a\\nman who will understand _him_? Shall I be able to trust you, and ask\\nyour help?â\\x80\\x9d That and nothing else was in the wistful anxious look. If\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s face had not been one which said â\\x80\\x9cYesâ\\x80\\x9d to all such questions,\\nshe would have turned away, and thought of him no more; as it was, she\\nlooked a second time with a touch of interest, a gleam of hope. The\\nbrother took no more apparent notice of her than if she had been a\\ncloak on his arm, except that from time to time he put out his thin\\nwhite hand to make sure that she was still there. He fixed his eyes on\\nColin with a kind of solemn steadfastness, which had a wonderful effect\\nupon the young man, and said something hasty and brief, a most summary\\npreface, about the beautiful night. â\\x80\\x9cAre you ill?â\\x80\\x9d he added, in the same\\nhasty, breathless way, as if impatient of wasting time on such\\npreliminaries. â\\x80\\x9cAre you going abroad for your health?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin, who was surprised by the question, felt almost disinclined to\\nanswer it--for in spite of himself it vexed him to think that anybody\\ncould read that necessity in his face. He said, â\\x80\\x9cI think so,â\\x80\\x9d with a\\nsmile which was not quite spontaneous; â\\x80\\x9cmy friends at least have that\\nmeaning,â\\x80\\x9d he added more naturally a moment afterwards, with the\\nintention of returning the question; but that possibility was taken\\nrapidly out of his hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave you ever thought of death?â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t start--I am\\ndying, or I would not ask you. When a man is dying he has privileges. Do\\nyou know that you are standing on the brink of a precipice? Have you\\never thought of death?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, a great deal,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. It would be wrong to say that the\\nquestion did not startle him; but, after the first strange shock of such\\nan address, an impulse of response and sympathy filled his mind. It\\nmight have been difficult to get into acquaintance by means of the\\nchit-chat of society, which requires a certain initiation; but such a\\ngrand subject was common ground. He answered as very few of the people\\ninterrogated by the sick man did answer. He did not show either alarm or\\nhorror--he started slightly, it is true, but he answered without much\\nhesitation:\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have thought often of death,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. Though he was only a\\nsecond-class passenger, this was a question which put all on an\\nequality; and now it was not difficult to understand why the captain\\neschewed his troublesome questioner, and how the people looked\\nembarrassed to whom he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, I am glad to hear such an answer,â\\x80\\x9d said the stranger; â\\x80\\x9cso few\\npeople can say so. You have found out, then, the true aim of life. Let\\nus walk about, for it is cold, and I must not shorten my working-days by\\nany devices of my own. My friend, give me a little hope that, at last, I\\nhave found a brother in Christ.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, gravely. He was still more startled by the\\nstrain in which his new companion proceeded; but a dying man _had_\\nprivileges. â\\x80\\x9cI hope so,â\\x80\\x9d Colin repeated; â\\x80\\x9cone of many here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, no, not of many,â\\x80\\x9d said the invalid; â\\x80\\x9cif you can feel certain of\\nbeing a child of God, it is what but few are permitted to do. My dear\\nfriend, it is not a subject to deceive ourselves upon. It is terribly\\nimportant for you and me. Are you sure that you are fleeing from the\\nwrath to come? Are you sure that you are prepared to meet your God?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey had turned into the full moonlight, which streamed upon their\\nfaces. The ship was rushing along through a sea still agitated by the\\nheavings of the past storm, and there was nothing moving on deck except\\nsome scattered seamen busy in their mysterious occupations. Colin was\\nslow to answer the new question thus addressed to him. He was still very\\nyoung; delicate, and reticent about all the secrets of his soul; not\\nwearing his heart upon his sleeve even in particulars less intimate and\\nmomentous than this. â\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid of my God,â\\x80\\x9d he said, after a\\nminuteâ\\x80\\x99s pause; â\\x80\\x9cpardon me, I am not used to speak much on such\\nsubjects. I cannot imagine that to meet God can be less than the\\ngreatest joy of which the soul is capable. He is our Father. I am not\\nafraid.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, my friend!â\\x80\\x9d said the eager stranger; his voice sounded in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\near like the voice of a desperate man in a lifeboat, calling to somebody\\nwho was drowning in a storm,--â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t deceive yourself; donâ\\x80\\x99t take up a\\nsentimental view of such an important matter. There is no escape except\\nthrough one way. The great object of our lives is to know how to\\ndie--and to die is despair, without Christ.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is it to live without Him?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI think the great object\\nof our lives is to live. Sometimes it is very hard work. And, when one\\nsees what is going on in the world, one does not know how it is possible\\nto keep living without Him,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, whose mind had taken a\\nprofound impression from the events of the last three months. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsee any meaning in the world otherwise. So far we are agreed. Death,\\nwhich interests you so much, will clear up all the rest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich interests me?â\\x80\\x9d said his new friend; â\\x80\\x9cif we were indeed rational\\ncreatures, would it not interest every one? Beyond every other subject,\\nbeyond every kind of ambition and occupation--think what it is to go out\\nof this life, with which we are familiar, to stand alone before God, to\\nanswer for the deeds done in the body----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen, if you are so afraid of God,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cwhat account do you\\nmake of Christ?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA gleam of strange light went over the gaunt eager face. He put out his\\nhand with his habitual movement, and laid it upon his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s hand,\\nwhich was clinging to his arm. â\\x80\\x9cAlice, hush!â\\x80\\x9d said the sick man; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t\\ninterrupt me. He speaks as if he knew what I mean; he speaks as if he\\ntoo had something to do with it. I may be able to do him good or he me.\\nI have not the pleasure of knowing your name,â\\x80\\x9d he said, suddenly turning\\nagain to Colin with the strangest difference of manner. â\\x80\\x9cMine is\\nMeredith. My sister and I will be glad if you will come to our cabin. I\\nshould like to have a little conversation with you. Will you come?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin would have said No; but the word was stayed on his lips by a\\nsudden look from the girl who had been drawn on along with them, without\\nany apparent will of her own. It was only in her eyes that any\\nindication of individual meaning on her part was visible. She did not\\nspeak, nor appear to think it necessary that she should second her\\nbrotherâ\\x80\\x99s invitation; but she gave Colin a hasty look, conveying such an\\nappeal as went to his heart. He did not understand it; if he had been\\nasked to save a manâ\\x80\\x99s life the petition could not have been addressed to\\nhim more imploringly. His own wish gave way instantly before the eager\\nsupplication of those eyes: not that he was charmed or attracted by her,\\nfor she was too much absorbed, and her existence too much wrapt up in\\nthat of her brother, to exercise any personal influence. A woman so\\npreoccupied had given up her privileges of woman. Accordingly, there was\\nno embarrassment in the direct appeal she made. The vainest man in\\nexistence could not have imagined that she cared for his visit on her\\nown account. Yet it was at her instance that Colin changed his original\\nintention, and followed them down below to the cabin. His mind was\\nsufficiently free to leave him at liberty to be interested in others,\\nand his curiosity was already roused.\\n\\nThe pair did not look less interesting when Colin sat with them at the\\ntable below, in the little cabin, which did not seem big enough to hold\\nanything else except the lamp. There, however, the sister exerted\\nherself to make tea, for which she had all the materials. She boiled her\\nlittle kettle over a spirit-lamp in a corner apart, and set everything\\nbefore them with a silent rapidity very wonderful to Colin, who\\nperceived at the same time that the sick man was impatient even of those\\nsoft and noiseless movements. He called to her to sit down two or three\\ntimes before she was ready, and visibly fumed over the slight commotion,\\ngentle as it was. He had seated himself in a corner of the hard little\\nsofa which occupied one side of the cabin, and where there already lay a\\npile of cushions for his comfort. His thoughts were fixed on eternity,\\nas he said and believed; but his body was profoundly sensitive to all\\nthe little annoyances of time. The light tread of his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s foot on\\nthe floor seemed to send a cruel vibration through him, and he glanced\\nround at her with a momentary glance of anger, which called forth an\\nanswering sentiment in the mind of Colin, who was looking on.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cForgive me, Arthur,â\\x80\\x9d said the girl, â\\x80\\x9cI am so clumsy; I canâ\\x80\\x99t help\\nitâ\\x80\\x9d--an apology which Arthur answered with a melancholy frown.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not you who are clumsy; it is the evil one who tempts me\\nperpetually, even by your means,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cTell me what your experience\\nis,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, turning to Colin with more eagerness than ever; â\\x80\\x9cI\\nfind some people who are embarrassed when I speak to them about the\\nstate of their souls; some who assent to everything I say, by way of\\ngetting done with it; some who are shocked and frightened, as if\\nspeaking of death would make them die the sooner. You alone have spoken\\nto me like a man who knows something about the matter. Tell me how you\\nhave grown familiar with the subject--tell me what your experiences\\nare.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPerhaps no request that could possibly have been made to Colin would\\nhave embarrassed him so much. He was interested and touched by the\\nstrange pair in whose company he found himself, and could not but regard\\nwith a pity, which had some fellow-feeling in it, the conscious state of\\nlife-in-death in which his questioner stood, who was not, at the same\\ntime, much older than himself, and still in what ought to be the flower\\nof his youth. Though his own thoughts were of a very different\\ncomplexion, Colin could not but be impressed by the aspect of the other\\nyouth, who was occupying the solemn position from which he himself\\nseemed to have escaped.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNeither of us can have much experience one way or another,â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nfeeling somehow his own limitations in the person of his new companion;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have been near dying; that is all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHave been!â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cAre you not--are not we all, near dying\\nnow? A gale more or less, a spark of fire, a wrong turn of the helm, and\\nwe are all in eternity! How can any reasonable creature be indifferent\\nfor a moment to such a terrible thought?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would be terrible, indeed, if God had nothing to do with it,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin; â\\x80\\x9cand, no doubt, death is terrible when one looks at it far off. I\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t think, however, that his face carries such terror when he is near.\\nThe only thing is the entire ignorance we are in. What it is--where it\\ncarries us--what is the extent of the separation it makes; all these\\nquestions are so hard to answer.â\\x80\\x9d Colinâ\\x80\\x99s eyes went away as he spoke;\\nand his new friend, like Matty Frankland, was puzzled and irritated by\\nthe look which he could not follow. He broke in hastily with a degree of\\npassion totally unlike Colinâ\\x80\\x99s calm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou think of it as a speculative question,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cI think of it as\\na dreadful reality. You seem at leisure to consider when and how; but\\nhave you ever considered the dreadful alternative? Have you never\\nimagined yourself one of the lost--in outer darkness--shut out and\\nseparated from all good--condemned to sink lower and lower? Have you\\never contemplated the possibility--?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, rising; â\\x80\\x9cI have never contemplated that possibility,\\nand I have no wish to do so now. Let us postpone the discussion. Nothing\\nanybody can say,â\\x80\\x9d the young man continued, holding out his hand to meet\\nthe feverish, thin fingers which were stretched towards him, â\\x80\\x9ccan make\\nme afraid of God.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot if you had to meet Him this night in judgment?â\\x80\\x9d said the solemn\\nvoice of the young prophet, who would not lose a last opportunity. The\\nwords and the look sent a strange chill through Colinâ\\x80\\x99s veins. His hand\\nwas held tight in the feverish hand of the sick man--the dark hollow\\neyes were looking him through and through. Death himself, could he have\\ntaken shape and form, could scarcely have confronted life in a more\\nsolemn guise. â\\x80\\x9cNot if you had to meet Him in judgment this night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou put the case very strongly,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who grew a little pale in\\nspite of himself. â\\x80\\x9cBut I answer, No--no. The Gospel has come for very\\nlittle purpose if it leaves any of His children in fear of the Heavenly\\nFather. No more to-night. You look tired, as you may well be, with all\\nyour exertions, and after this rough weather--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe rough weather is nothing to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cI must work while\\nit is day--the night cometh in which no man can work.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe night has come,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, doing the best he could to smile;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe human night, in which men do not attempt to work. Donâ\\x80\\x99t you think\\nyou should obey the natural ordinances as well as the spiritual?\\nTo-morrow we will meet, better qualified to discuss the question.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTo-morrow we may meet in eternity,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmen; the question will be clear then, and we shall have no need to\\ndiscuss it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. This time he managed better to smile. â\\x80\\x9cBut,\\nwherever we meet to-morrow, good-bye for to-night--good-bye. You know\\nwhat the word means,â\\x80\\x9d he said. He smiled to himself even at the thoughts\\nsuggested to him by his own words. He too was pale, and had no great\\nappearance of strength. If he himself felt the current of life flowing\\nback into his veins, the world and even his friends were scarcely of his\\nopinion. He looked but a little way farther off from the solemn verge\\nthan his new acquaintance did, as he stood at the door of the little\\ncabin, his face lit up with the vague, sweet, brightening of a smile,\\nwhich was not called forth by anything external, but came out of the\\nmusings and memories of his own heart. Such a smile could not be\\ncounterfeit. When he had turned towards the narrow stair which led to\\nthe deck, he felt a touch upon his arm, like the touch of a bird, it was\\nso light and momentary. â\\x80\\x9cCome again,â\\x80\\x9d said a voice in his ear, â\\x80\\x9ccome\\nagain.â\\x80\\x9d He knew it was the sister who spoke; but the voice did not sound\\nin Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ears as the voice of a woman to a man. It was impersonal,\\ndisembodied, independent of all common restrictions. She had merged her\\nidentity altogether in that of her brother. All the light, all the\\nwarmth, all the human influence she had, she was pouring into him, like\\na lantern, bright only for the bearer, turning a dark side to the world.\\n\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s head throbbed and felt giddy when he emerged into the open air\\nabove, into the cold moonlight, to which the heaving of the sea gave a\\nlook of disturbance and agitation which almost reached the length of\\npain. There was nothing akin in that passionless light to the tumult of\\nthe great chafing ocean, the element most like humanity. True, it was\\nnot real storm, but only the long pantings of the vast bosom, after one\\nof those anger-fits to which the giant is prone; but a fanciful\\nspectator could not but link all kinds of imaginations to the night, and\\nColin was pre-eminently a fanciful spectator. It looked like the man\\nstorming, the woman watching with looks of powerless anguish; or like\\nthe world heaving and struggling, and some angel of heaven grieving and\\nlooking on. Colin lingered on the deck, though it was cold, and rest was\\nneedful. What could there be in the future existence more dark, more\\nhopeless than the terrible enigmas which built up their dead walls\\naround a man in this world, and passed interpretation. Even the darkest\\nhell of poetic invention comprehended itself and knew why it was; but\\nthis life, who comprehended, who could explain?\\n\\nThe thought was very different from those with which Arthur Meredith\\nresigned himself reluctantly to rest. He could not consent to sleep till\\nhe had written a page or two of the book which he meant to leave as a\\nlegacy to the world, and which was to be called â\\x80\\x9cA Voice from the\\nGrave.â\\x80\\x9d This poor young fellow had forgotten that God Himself was likely\\nto take some pains about the world which had cost so much. After the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cunspeakable giftâ\\x80\\x9d once for all, it appeared to young Meredith that the\\nrest of the work was left on _his_ shoulders, and on the shoulders of\\nsuch as he; and, accordingly he wore his dying strength out, addressing\\neverybody in season and out of season, and working at â\\x80\\x9cA Voice from the\\nGrave.â\\x80\\x9d A strange voice it was--saying little that was consolatory; yet,\\nin its way, true, as everything is true in a certain limited sense which\\ncomes from the heart. The name of the Redeemer was named a great many\\ntimes therein, but the spirit of it was as if no Redeemer had ever come.\\nA world, dark, confused, and full of judgments and punishments--a world\\nin which men would not believe though one rose from the grave--was the\\nworld into which he looked, and for which he was working. His sister\\nAlice, watching by his side, noting with keen anxiety every time the pen\\nslipped from his fingers, every time it went vaguely over the paper in\\nstarts which told he had gone half to sleep over his work, sat with her\\nintelligence unawakened, and her whole being slumbering, thinking of\\nnothing but him. After all, Colin was not so fanciful when in his heart\\nit occurred to him to connect these two with the appearance of the moon\\nand the sea. They had opened the book of their life to him fortuitously,\\nwithout any explanations, and he did not know what to make of it. When\\nhe descended to his own cabin and found Lauderdale fast asleep, the\\nyoung man could not but give a little time to the consideration of this\\nnew scene which had opened in his life. It was natural to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s age\\nand temperament to expect that something would come of such a strange,\\naccidental meeting; and so he lay and pondered it, looking out at the\\ntroubled moonlight on the water, till that disturbed guardian of the\\nnight had left her big troublesome charge to himself. The ship ploughed\\nalong its lonely road with tolerable composure and quietness, for the\\nfirst time since it set out, and permitted to some of its weary\\npassengers unwonted comfort and repose; but, as for Colin, a sense of\\nhaving set out upon a new voyage came into his mind, he could not tell\\nwhy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no saying if Iâ\\x80\\x99m well or ill,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m saying itâ\\x80\\x99s\\ngrand for you to leave your friends in a suffering condition, and go off\\nand make up to other folk. Itâ\\x80\\x99s well to be off with the old love--for my\\nown part, however,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s Mentor, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no for having a great deal\\nto do with women. Theyâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 doubtful creatures, you may take my word\\nfor it; some seem about as good as the angels--no that I have any\\npersonal acquaintance with the angels, but itâ\\x80\\x99s aye an intelligible\\nmetaphor--some just as far on the other side. Besides, itâ\\x80\\x99s a poor thing\\nfor a man to fritter away what little capability of a true feeling there\\nmay be in him. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no fancy for the kind of friendships that are\\ncarried on after the manner of flirtations. For my part, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a believer\\nin _love_,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with a sudden fervour of reproof which\\nbrought an unusual amount of colour to his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are absurd all the same,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, laughing; â\\x80\\x9chere is no\\nquestion either of love, or flirtation, or even of friendship. I know\\nwhat you mean,â\\x80\\x9d he added with a slightly heightened colour; â\\x80\\x9cyou think\\nthat, having once imagined I admired Miss Frankland, I ought to have\\ncontinued in the same mind all my life. You donâ\\x80\\x99t appreciate my good\\nsense, Lauderdale; but, at all events, the young lady has nothing to do\\nwith my interest here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was saying nothing about Miss Frankland,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cI was\\nmaking a confession of faith on my own part, which has naething to do\\nwith you that I can see. As for the young leddy, as you say, if it\\ndoesna begin with her, itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 the more likely to end with her,\\naccording to my experience. To be sure, thereâ\\x80\\x99s no great amount of time;\\nbut a boat like this is provocative of intimacy. Youâ\\x80\\x99re aye in the\\nsecond cabin, which is a kind of safeguard; but, as for your good\\nsense--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t associate that poor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s name with anything ridiculous,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin, â\\x80\\x9cbut come up on deck, like a reasonable man, and judge for\\nyourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, slowly; â\\x80\\x9cI understand the kind of thing. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nseen it many a day myself. Partly youthfulness, that thinks the thing\\nthat is happening to itself more important than anything else in the\\nworld; partly a kind of self-regard; partly a wish to take compensation\\nout of the world for what has to be given up. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying but thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsomething better at the bottom, but itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to separate the\\nphysical and the spiritual. I wouldna say but even you, your own\\nself--but it took a different form with you,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, stopping\\nshort abruptly. Looking at Colin, and seeing that still there was not\\nmuch bloom on his worn cheeks, it occurred to his careful guardian that\\nit might be as well not to recall the distempered thoughts of the\\nsick-room at Wodensbourne to his patientâ\\x80\\x99s mind too soon.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose you are right,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cit took a different form with\\nme. A more undutiful, unbelieving form; for Meredith makes no question\\nwhat it means, as I used to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no so clear of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s seldom unbelief that\\nasks a reason. I would not say, now Iâ\\x80\\x99m on my feet, but what there may\\nbe a place known among men by the name of Italy. Come, callant, and let\\nme see if the skies are aught like what they are at hame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nEverything was changed when Colin and his friend stood again on deck.\\nThe calm weather had restored to life the crowd of sea-sick passengers\\nwho, like Lauderdale, had, up to this moment, kept themselves and their\\nmiseries under cover below. The universal scepticism and doubt of ever\\nbeing better had given way to a cheerful confidence. Everybody\\nbelieved--happy in his delusion--that for himself he had mastered the\\ndemon, and would be sea-sick no more. Among so many, it was not so easy\\nto distinguish Meredith as Colin had expected; and he had time to\\ndiscuss several matters with Lauderdale, showing a certain acrid feeling\\non his side of the question which surprised his interlocutor, before his\\nnew friends appeared. Colin had taken his second-class berth gladly\\nenough, without thinking of any drawback; but, when he saw the limit\\nclearly before his eyes, and perceived within reach, and indeed within\\nhearing, the little â\\x80\\x9csocietyâ\\x80\\x9d which he was not able to join, the fact of\\nthis momentary inferiority chafed him a little. Like most other people,\\nhe had a dislike to the second place--not that he cared about society,\\nas he took pains to convince himself. But the truth was, that Colin did\\ncare for society, and, though too proud to confess such a thought, even\\nto himself, secretly longed to join those new groups which were\\ngradually growing into acquaintance before his eyes.\\n\\nWhen he saw the two figures approaching which had attracted him so\\nstrongly on the previous night, his heart gave a little jump, though his\\neyes were fixed in another direction. They were not only two curious\\nhuman creatures whom it was hard to comprehend, but, at the same time,\\nthey represented the world to Colin, who was at this present moment shut\\nout from intercourse with everybody but Lauderdale, whose manner of\\nmusing he knew by heart. He did not look round, but he heard the\\nfootsteps approaching, and would have been equally disappointed and\\nirritated had they turned back. This danger, however, speedily\\nterminated. Meredith came up hastily, drawing along with him, as usual,\\nthe sister who had not any being except in him, and laid his thin hand\\non Colinâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder. The sunshine and the brightened skies did not\\nchange the strain of the young preacherâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts. He laid his hand on\\nColin, pressing the young manâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder with an emphatic touch. â\\x80\\x9cWe\\nmeet again in the land of living men, in the place of hope,â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nturning his sister with him as he turned. She clung to him so closely\\nthat they moved like one, without any apparent volition on her part; and\\neven Colinâ\\x80\\x99s salutation seemed to disturb her, as if it had been\\nsomething unnecessary and unexpected. Her little hurried bow, her lips\\nthat just parted in an anxious momentary smile, had a certain surprise\\nin them; and there was even a little impatience, as if she had said,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnswer _him_; why should you mind me?â\\x80\\x9d in the turn of her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, we meet on a bright morning, which looks like life and hope,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin; â\\x80\\x9cand everybody seems disposed to enjoy it; even my friend here,\\nwho has been helpless since we started, has come to life at last.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus directed, Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s eager eyes turned to Lauderdale, upon whom\\nthey paused with their usual solemn inquiring look. â\\x80\\x9cI hope he has come\\nto life in a higher sense,â\\x80\\x9d said the sick man, who thought it his duty\\nto speak in season and out of season; â\\x80\\x9cbut for that true life, existence\\nis only the payment of a terrible penalty. I hope, like you, he has\\nthought on the great subject.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhen he stopped short, and looked straight in Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s face, there\\nwas a wonderful silence over the little group. The dying prophet said\\nnothing more, but looked down, awful and abstracted, from the heights of\\ndeath on which he was standing, to receive an answer, which Lauderdale\\nwas too much taken by surprise, and Colin too much alarmed for the\\nresult of the inquiry, to give at once.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve thought on an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 quantity of subjects,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, after\\na moment; â\\x80\\x9ca hundred or two more than can have gone through your mind at\\nyour age; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no averse to unfolding my experiences, as this callant\\nwill tell you,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a smile, which, however, was lost upon\\nhis questioner.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYour experiences!â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. He put his thin arm eagerly, before\\nany one was aware what he intended to do, through Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s arm. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nfrighten and horrify many,â\\x80\\x9d said the invalid, not without a gleam of\\nsatisfaction; â\\x80\\x9cbut there are so few, so miserably few, with whom it is\\npossible to have true communion. Let me share your experiences--there\\nmust be instruction in them.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe philosopher, thus seized, made a comical grimace, unseen by anybody\\nbut Colin; but the sick man was far too much in earnest to observe any\\nreluctance on the part of his new acquaintance, and Lauderdale submitted\\nto be swept on in the strange wind of haste and anxiety and eagerness\\nwhich surrounded the dying youth, to whom a world lying in wickedness,\\nand â\\x80\\x9cI, I aloneâ\\x80\\x9d left to maintain the knowledge of God among men, was\\nthe one great truth. There was not much room to move about upon the\\ndeck; and, as Meredith turned and went on, with his arm in Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s,\\nhis sister, who was sharply turned round also by his movement, found it\\nhard enough to maintain her position by his side. Though he was more\\nattached to her than to any other living creature, it was not his habit,\\nas it might have been in happier circumstances, to care for her comfort,\\nor to concern himself about her personal convenience. He swept her along\\nwith him over the hampered deck, through passages which were barely wide\\nenough for two, but through which she crushed herself as long as\\npossible, catching her dress on all the corners, and losing her breath\\nin the effort. As for Colin, he found himself left behind with a\\nhalf-amazed, half-mortified sensation.\\n\\n    Not his the form, not his the eye,\\n    That youthful maidens wont to fly;\\n\\nand though he was not truly open to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s jibe concerning\\nflirtations, the very name of that agreeable but dangerous amusement had\\nroused him into making the discovery that Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s sister was very\\npretty, and that there was something extremely interesting in the rapt\\ndevotion to her brother, which at first had prevented him from observing\\nher. It seemed only natural that, when the sick man seized upon\\nLauderdale, the young lady should have fallen to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s share; and he\\nkept standing where they had left him, as has been described, half\\namused and half mortified, thinking to himself that, after all, he was\\nnot an ogre, nor a person whom ladies in general are apt to avoid.\\n\\nAfter poor little Alice had hurt herself and torn her dress in two or\\nthree rapid turns through the limited space, she gave up her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\narm with a pained, surprised look, which went to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and\\nwithdrew to the nearest bench, gathering up her torn dress in her hand,\\nand still keeping her eyes upon him. What good she thought she could do\\nby her watching it was difficult to tell, but it evidently was the\\nentire occupation and object of her life. She scarcely turned her eyes\\nupon Colin when he approached; and, as the eyes were like a\\nfawnâ\\x80\\x99s--brown, wistful, and appealing (whereas Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s were blue,\\nand addicted to laughter)--it is not to be wondered at that Colin, in\\nwhom his youth was dimly reawaking, with all its happier\\nsusceptibilities, should feel a little pique at her neglect. The shadow\\nof death had floated away from the young manâ\\x80\\x99s horizon. He believed\\nhimself, whether truly or not, to have come to a new beginning of life.\\nHe had been dead and was alive again; and the solemn interval of\\nsuffering, during which he questioned earth and heaven, had made the\\nrebound all the sweeter, and restored with a freshness almost more\\ndelightful than the first, the dews and blossoms to the new world. Thus\\nhe approached Alice Meredith, who had no attention to spare to him--not\\nwith any idea that he had fallen in love with her, or that love was\\nlikely, but only with that vague sense that Paradise still exists\\nsomewhere, not entirely out of reach, and that the sweet Eve, who alone\\ncan reveal it, might meet him unawares at any turn of his path--which is\\none of the sweetest privileges of youth. But he did not know what to say\\nto the other youthful creature, who ought to have been as conscious of\\nsuch possibilities as he. No thought was in _her_ mind that she ever\\ncould be the Eve of any paradise; and the world to her was a confused\\nand darkling universe, in which death lay lurking somewhere, she could\\nnot tell how close at hand--death, not for herself, which could be\\nborne, but for one far dearer than herself. The more she felt the\\nnearness of this adversary, the more she contradicted herself and would\\nnot believe it; and so darkness spread all round the beginning path of\\nthe poor girl, who was not much more than a child. She would not have\\nunderstood the meaning of any pretty speeches had Colin been so far left\\nto himself as to think of making them. As it was, she looked up at him\\nwistfully as he sat down beside her. She thought in her mind that he\\nwould be a good friend for Arthur, and might cheer him; which was the\\nchief thing she cared for in this world.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHas your brother been long ill?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. It seemed the only subject\\non which the two could speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIll?â\\x80\\x9d said Alice; â\\x80\\x9che is not very ill--he takes a great deal of\\nexercise. You must have observed that; and his appetite is very good.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThe question roused her to contradict her own fears, and doing so out\\nloud to another was more effectual somehow than anything she could say\\nto herself. â\\x80\\x9cThe storm which made everybody else so ill had no effect\\nupon Arthur,â\\x80\\x9d she went on, almost with a little irritation. â\\x80\\x9cHe is thin\\nto be sure, but then many people are thin who are quite well; and I am\\nsure you do not look very strong yourself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who possessed the instinct rare among men of divining\\nwhat his companion wished him to say; â\\x80\\x9cmy people had given me up a few\\nweeks ago. I gave myself a poke somewhere in the lungs which very nearly\\nmade an end of me; but I mean to get better if I can,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a\\nsmile, which for the moment brought a doubtful look upon the girlâ\\x80\\x99s\\nface.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t think it wrong to talk like that,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cthat was what\\nmade me wish so much you should come to see Arthur. Perhaps if he were\\nmore cheerful it would do him good. Not that he is very ill, you know,\\nbut still--we are going to Italy,â\\x80\\x9d she went on with a little abruptness,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cto a place near Rome--not to Rome itself, because I am a little afraid\\nof that--but into the country. Are you going there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cit is the most interesting place in the\\nworld. Do you not think so? But everything will be new to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you were to come where we are going,â\\x80\\x9d said his companion with a\\ncomposure which was wonderful to Colin, â\\x80\\x9cyou would find it cheaper, and\\nyou could see things almost as easily, and it would not be so hot when\\nsummer comes. I think it would do Arthur a great deal of good. It is so\\nhard to know what to do with a man,â\\x80\\x9d she went on, unconsciously yielding\\nto that inexpressible influence of a sympathetic listener which few\\npeople can resist; â\\x80\\x9cthey cannot occupy themselves, you know, as we women\\ncan, and they get tired of _our_ society. I have so longed to find some\\nman who would understand him, and whom he could talk to,â\\x80\\x9d cried the\\npoor girl, with tears in her eyes. She made a pause when she had said so\\nmuch--not that it occurred to her that any one could misunderstand her,\\nbut because the tears were getting into her voice, which was a weakness\\nnot to be yielded to. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know why I should cry,â\\x80\\x9d she added a\\nminute after, with a faint smile; â\\x80\\x9cit is talking about Italy I suppose;\\nbut you will like it when you get there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYet you do not seem to like it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a little curiosity.\\n\\nThis time she made him no direct answer. Her eyes were following her\\nbrother and Lauderdale as they walked about the deck. â\\x80\\x9cIs _he_ nice?â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe asked, with a little timidity, pointing at Lauderdale, and giving\\nanother hasty wistful look at Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know if you would think so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9che is very Scotch,\\nand a little odd sometimes; but kinder and better, and more truly a\\nfriend than words can describe. He is tender and true,â\\x80\\x9d said the young\\nman, with a little enthusiasm which woke up the palest ghost of an\\nanswering light in his young companionâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeing Scotch is a recommendation to me,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cthe only person I\\never loved, except Arthur, of course,--and those who are gone--was\\nScotch.â\\x80\\x9d After this quaint intimation, which woke in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind an\\nincipient spark of the earliest stage of jealousy--not jealousy proper,\\nbut only a lively and contemptuous curiosity to know â\\x80\\x9cwho the fellow\\nwasâ\\x80\\x9d--she dropped back again into her habitual silence. When Colin tried\\nto bring her back by ordinary remarks about the voyage and their\\ndestination, she answered him simply by â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cNo.â\\x80\\x9d She was of one\\nidea, incapable apparently of exerting her mind on any other subject.\\nWhen they had been thus sitting silent for some time, she began again\\nabruptly at the point where she had left off.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you were to come to the same place,â\\x80\\x9d she said--â\\x80\\x9cArthur can speak\\nItalian very well, and I know it a little--we might be able to help you,\\nand you would have very good air--pure air off the sea. If he had\\nsociety he would soon be better.â\\x80\\x9d This was said softly to herself; and\\nthen she went on, drawn farther and farther by the sympathy which she\\nfelt in her listener. â\\x80\\x9cThere are only us two in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I can do anything,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cas long as we are here at least;\\nbut there is no lack of society,â\\x80\\x9d he said, pointing to the groups on\\nthe quarter-deck, at which Alice Meredith shook her head.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe frightens them,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cthey prefer to go out of his way; they\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t want to answer his questions. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know why he does it. When he\\nwas young he was fond of society, and went out a great deal, but he has\\nchanged so much of late,â\\x80\\x9d said the anxious sister, with a certain look\\nof doubt and wonder on her face. She was not quite sure whether the\\nchange was an improvement. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t understand it very well myself,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nwent on, with a sigh; â\\x80\\x9cperhaps I have not thought enough about it. And\\nthen he does not mind what I say to him--men never do; I suppose it is\\nnatural. But, if he had society, and you would talk and keep him from\\nwriting--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes he write?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with new interest. It was a bond of\\nsympathy he had not expected to hear of; and here again the tears, in\\nspite of all her exertions, got into Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAt night, when he ought to be sleeping,â\\x80\\x9d said the poor girl. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nmean to say he is very ill; but, oh! Mr. Campbell, is it not enough to\\nmake any man ill to sit up when he is so tired he cannot keep awake,\\nwriting that dreadful book? He is going to call it â\\x80\\x9cA Voice from the\\nGrave.â\\x80\\x9d I sometimes think he wants to break my heart; for what has the\\ngrave to do with it? He is rather delicate, but so are you. Most people\\nare delicate,â\\x80\\x9d said poor Alice, â\\x80\\x9cwhen they sit up at night, and donâ\\x80\\x99t\\ntake care of themselves. If you could only get him to give up that book,\\nI would bless you all my life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuch an appeal from sweet lips quivering with suppressed anguish, from\\nbeautiful eyes full of heavy tears, was not likely to be without effect;\\nand, when Colin went to his own cabin in the evening, hearing but\\nimperfectly the criticisms of Lauderdale on his new friend and his\\naffairs, he was more and more impressed by the conviction that something\\nmust come of an encounter so singular and unexpected. The young man\\nimmediately set himself to wind new threads of fate about his feet, and\\nwhile he was doing so, thought with a little thrill of the wonderful way\\nin which things came about, and the possible purposes of Providence in\\nthis new change. It roused and excited him to see the new scenery coming\\ninto its place, and the ground preparing for another act of his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat for?â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no say but what itâ\\x80\\x99s an interesting\\nstudy, if life was long enough to allow such indulgences; but--take you\\nmy word for it, callant--itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to see a life wearing out like\\nthat, drop by drop. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not only that you might get to be fond of the\\npoor lad himself, and miss him sair when he was gone,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, who had not just then perfect command of himself; â\\x80\\x9cbut it\\nraises awfuâ\\x80\\x99 questions, and you are not one of those that can take\\nthings as they come and ask no reason. What should you bind yourself\\nfor! I see aâ\\x80\\x99 that would happen as clear as day. You would go into a bit\\ncountry place with him, only to watch him die; and, when he was gone,\\nyou would be left with the bit bonnie sister, two bairns together--and\\nthen--but youâ\\x80\\x99re no destitute of imagination,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, grimly;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand I leave you to figure that part of the business to yourselâ\\x80\\x99.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis is foolish talk,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThe sister, except that I am very\\nsorry for her, has nothing in the world to do with it. If we could\\nmanage as well beside them as anywhere else, one should be glad to be of\\nsome use to oneâ\\x80\\x99s fellow-creatures. I am not afraid of anything that\\nmight happen,â\\x80\\x9d the young man added, with a slight additional colour. â\\x80\\x9cAs\\nfor responsibility, it is strange to hear you warning me against\\nthat--you who were willing to take upon yourself all the responsibility\\nof travelling with me when you thought I was dying--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo such thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, hotly. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m fool enough, no doubt, but\\nno such a fool as that. Callants of your age canna keep a medium. When\\nyou have a sore finger you take thoughts of dying; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m a man of some\\nexperience in this world. Iâ\\x80\\x99m travelling for my own pleasure and no for\\nyou, nor no man. As for this lad, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen the like before. Heâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nsingular, though Iâ\\x80\\x99ve little doubt he thinks he is. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard work\\nto stop short just when youâ\\x80\\x99ve come to the brow of the hill, and see aâ\\x80\\x99\\nthe fair prospect before you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian, whose countenance\\nwas overcast and cloudy. â\\x80\\x9cWhen the mindâ\\x80\\x99s no very strong, the like of\\nthat sets it off its balance. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen them that came out of the trial\\nas calm as the angels of God,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, after a little pause, with a\\nstrain in his voice which showed unusual emotion; â\\x80\\x9cand I have seen them\\nthat battled with Him that made them, to make Him render a reason; and I\\nhave seen them that took it with a high hand, and turned into preachers\\nlike this one. â\\x80\\x98A Voice from the Grave,â\\x80\\x99 did she say? But youâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99\\nbabies that ken no better. How are the like of you to know that thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nmen like me--ay, and women more than men--that would give aâ\\x80\\x99 their\\nliving, and would not grudge life itself, no for a voice only, but for\\ntwo or three words--for one word and no more.â\\x80\\x9d He put down his face in\\nhis hands for a moment as he spoke, though not to conceal tears; for\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s sorrows, whatever they might have been, were wrapped in the\\ndeadly stillness of that past grief with which no stranger intermeddles;\\nand his young companion watched him sorrowfully, sympathetically, but in\\nignorance, and with the timidity of youth, not knowing what to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHim, and the like of him,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, going on more softly when\\nhe found that Colin made no reply, â\\x80\\x9ctheir voice from the grave is like a\\nHalloween ghost to frighten the unwary. Whisht, callant! Iâ\\x80\\x99m no laughing\\nat the poor dying lad. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae laughing in my head one way or\\nanother; but itâ\\x80\\x99s so little you know. You never think, with your\\nwarnings and your terrors, of us that have sat by our graves for years,\\nand been confounded by the awfuâ\\x80\\x99 silence. Why can they no speak nor we\\nhear? Youâ\\x80\\x99ll no tell me that Heaven and the presence of God can take the\\nlove out of a living soul. I wish you would not disturb my mind with\\nyour vain thoughts; itâ\\x80\\x99s no a question I dare go into. If loveâ\\x80\\x99s no\\neverlasting, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no desire to be everlasting myself; and, if Iâ\\x80\\x99m to be\\nno more hereafter to them that belong to me, than to legions of strange\\nangels, or a haill nation of fremd folk!--Whisht, callant! youâ\\x80\\x99re no to\\nsay such things to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin said nothing at all to interrupt this monologue. He let his friend\\nwear himself out, pacing up and down the narrow little cabin, which it\\nrequired but two of Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s strides to traverse from end to end. He\\nhad known a chance word to produce similar results before, but had never\\nbeen made acquainted with the real history of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s life. He\\nwaited now till this excitement was over, knowing by experience that it\\nwas the best way; and, after a while, Lauderdale calmed down and came\\nback to his seat, and resumed the conversation where he had left it,\\nbefore his heart within him was roused to make brief utterance of its\\nunknown burden.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe short and the long of it is,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cthat youâ\\x80\\x99re making\\nup your mind, by some process of your own--Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying what it is--to\\ngive up our own plan and tack yourself on to a poor failing callant\\nthat has not above a month or two to live?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow do you know he has not above a month or two to live?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou thought the same of me a few weeks ago. One hears of the climate\\nworking wonders; and, if he had some one by him to amuse and interest\\nhim, and keep him off that book, as--as Miss Meredith says--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, no doubt, no doubt,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, drily. â\\x80\\x9cHe has one nurse\\nalready bound to him body and soul, and maybe, if he had another to\\nundertake the spiritual department--! But youâ\\x80\\x99re no old enough, callant,\\nto take him in hand, and youâ\\x80\\x99re no strong enough, and I cannot say, for\\nmy own part, that I see any special qualification for such an office in\\nye,â\\x80\\x9d said the merciless critic, looking at Colin in a seriously\\ncontemplative way, with his head a little on one side. After he had\\nshown any deep emotion, Lauderdale, like a true Briton, despised\\nhimself, and made as great a leap as was practicable on the other side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was a little piqued in spite of himself; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nsuppose I am good for much; and I never thought of being his nurse. It\\nis out of the question to imagine that I could be for Meredith, or any\\nother man, what you have been for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve kent ye longer than two days,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian, without\\nshowing any signs of propitiation, â\\x80\\x9cwhich to be sure makes a little\\ndifference. Though them that are destined to come together need little\\ntime to make it up--Iâ\\x80\\x99ve aye been a believer, for my part, not only in\\nlove, but in friendship, at first sight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no question of either love or friendship,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with\\nprompt irritation. â\\x80\\x9cSurely one may feel pity, sympathy, fellow-feeling,\\nwith a man of oneâ\\x80\\x99s own age without being misunderstood.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI understand you an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal better than you understand yourself,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cand, as I was saying, I am a great believer in first\\nimpressions. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a mercenary kind of thing to be friends with a man for\\nhis good qualities--thereâ\\x80\\x99s a kind of barter in it that goes against my\\ninstincts; but, when you take to a man for nae reason, but out of pure\\nelection and choice, thatâ\\x80\\x99s real friendship--or love, as it might be,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe went on, without pity, enjoying the heightened colour and air of\\nembarrassment on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou say all this to make me lose my temper,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t let us\\ntalk of it any more to-night; I will think it all over again, since you\\noppose it, and to-morrow--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, to-morrow,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale--â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s a bonnie new world, and weâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\ninterfere with it. Good-night, callant; Iâ\\x80\\x99m no a man that can be\\nquarrelled with if you tried ever so hard; to-morrow youâ\\x80\\x99ll take your\\nown way.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin did not sleep till the night was far advanced. He lay awake,\\nwatching the moonlight, and pondering over this matter, which looked\\nvery important as he contemplated it. By thinking was meant, in his\\nmind, as in most minds of his age, not any complicated course of\\nreasoning, but a rapid framing of pictures on one side and the other. On\\none side he saw Meredith beguiled from his book, persuaded to moderate\\nhis words in season and out of season, and induced to take a little\\ninterest in ordinary human affairs, gradually recovering his health, and\\nreturning to a life which should no longer appear to him a near\\npreparation for dying; and it cannot be denied that there did come into\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s mind a certain consciousness of grateful looks and sweet-voiced\\nthanks attending this restoration, which made the picture wonderfully\\npleasant. Then, on the other side, there was Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s sketch of the\\nsadder possibilities filled in by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s imagination:--poor Meredith\\ndying slowly, looking death in the face for long days and lonely nights,\\nsorely wanting all the succour that human compassion could give him; and\\nthe forlorn and solitary mourner that would be left, so young and\\nfriendless, by the strangerâ\\x80\\x99s grave. Perhaps, on the whole, this\\nsuggestion of Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s decided the matter. The thought was too\\npitiful, too sad to be borne. She was nothing in the world to him; but\\nshe was a woman, and Colin thought indignantly of the unchristian\\ncowardice which, for fear of responsibility, would desert a friendless\\ncreature exposed to such dangers. Notwithstanding, he was prudent, very\\nprudent, as was natural. It was not Alice, but Arthur Meredith who was\\nto be his friend. She had nothing to do with this decision whatever. If\\nsuch a melancholy necessity should happen, Colin felt it was in him,\\nrespectfully, sympathetically, to take the poor girl home; and if,\\nsomehow, the word â\\x80\\x9chomeâ\\x80\\x9d suggested to him his mother, who that knew\\nanything of the Mistress, could wonder at that thought?\\n\\nThus he went on drawing the meshes closer about his feet, while the\\nmoonlight shone on the sea, and poor Meredith wrote his book, and\\nLauderdale, as sleepless as his charge, anxiously pondered the new state\\nof affairs. At home that same moon suggested Colin to more minds than\\none in the peaceful country over which the March winds were blowing.\\nMiss Matty thought of him, looking out over the Wodensbourne avenue,\\nwhere the great trees stood stately in the moonlight with a glory on\\ntheir heads. She was so late because she had been at a ball, where her\\ncousin Harry had made himself highly disagreeable, and where, prompted\\nby his sulky looks, she had carried a little flirtation a hairâ\\x80\\x99s-breadth\\ntoo far--which was not a comfortable consciousness. Why she should think\\nof Colin under such circumstances it would be hard to say; but the\\nthoughts of a young woman at three oâ\\x80\\x99clock in the morning are not\\nexpected to be logical. She thought of him with a shadow of the same\\nfeeling that made the Psalmist long for the wings of a dove; though, if\\nMiss Matty had but known it, her reception--could she have made her\\nescape to her former worshipper at that moment--would have been of a\\ndisappointing character. And about the same time the Mistress woke out\\nof her quiet sleep, and saw the broad, white flood of light streaming\\nthrough the little square window of the room in which Colin was born.\\nHer fancy was busy enough about him night and day; and she fancied she\\ncould see, as clear as in a picture, the ship speeding on, with perhaps\\nits white wings spread over the glistening sea, and the moon stealing in\\nat the cabin window, and caressing her boy, who must be fast asleep,\\nresting and gathering strength, with new life breathing in upon him in\\nevery breath of favourable wind that crisped the sleeping sea. Such was\\nthe vision that came to the mind of the Mistress when she woke in the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cdead of night,â\\x80\\x9d and saw the moonlight at her window. â\\x80\\x9cGod bless my\\nColin,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, as she closed her tender eyes; and in the\\nmeantime Colin, thinking nothing of his old love, and not very much of\\nhis home, was busily engaged in weaving for himself another tangle in\\nthe varied web of existence--although none of the people most interested\\nin him--except Lauderdale, who saw a faint shadow of the future--had the\\nleast idea that this night at sea was of any moment in his life. He did\\nnot know it himself, though he was conscious of a certain thrill of\\npleasant excitement and youthful awe, half voluntary, half real. And so\\nthe new scene got arranged for this new act of the wonderful drama; and\\nall the marvellous, delicate influences of Providence and will, poising\\nand balancing each other, began to form and shape the further outlines\\nof his life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX.\\n\\n\\nThe place which the Merediths had chosen for their residence was\\nFrascati, where everything was quieter, and most things cheaper, than in\\nRome--to which, besides, the brother and sister had objections, founded\\non former passages in their family history, of which their new friends\\nwere but partially aware; and to Frascati, accordingly, the two Scotch\\npilgrims were drawn with them. Colin had, as usual, persevered in his\\nown way, as Lauderdale prophesied, and the arrangement came about,\\nnaturally enough, after the ten daysâ\\x80\\x99 close company on board ship, where\\nyoung Meredith, whom most people were either contemptuous of, or\\ninclined to avoid, found refuge with his new friends, who, though they\\ndid not agree with him, at least understood what he meant. He slackened\\nnothing of those exertions which he thought to be his duty--and on\\nwhich, perhaps unconsciously, the young invalid rather prided himself,\\nas belonging to his _rÃ´le_ of dying man,--during the remainder of the\\nvoyage; but, finding one of the sailors ill, succeeded in making such an\\nimpression upon the poor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s uninstructed and uncertain mind as\\nrepaid him, he said, for all the exertions he had made. After that\\nevent, he went very often to the forecastle to pray with his convert,\\nbeing, perhaps, disposed to the opinion that they two were the salt of\\nthe earth to their small community; for which proceeding he was called\\nfool, and fanatic, and Methodist, and a great many other hard names by\\nthe majority of his fellow-passengers--some of whom, indeed, being, like\\nmost ordinary people, totally unable to discriminate between things that\\ndiffer, confidently expected to hear of some secret vice on the part of\\nMeredith; such things being always found out, as they maintained, of\\npeople who considered themselves better than their neighbours. â\\x80\\x9cAfter a\\nwhile, it will be found out what heâ\\x80\\x99s up to,â\\x80\\x9d said a comfortable\\npassenger, who knew the world; â\\x80\\x9csuch fellows always have their private\\npeccadilloes. I daresay he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t go so often to the forecastle for\\nnothing. The stewardess ainâ\\x80\\x99t bad looking, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen our saint\\nengaged in private conversation when he didnâ\\x80\\x99t know I was there,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe large-minded Christian who denounced poor Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s\\nuncharitableness. And, to be sure, he was uncharitable, poor fellow. As\\nfor Colin, and, indeed, Lauderdale also, who had been attracted, in\\nspite of himself, they looked on with a wonderful interest, from\\namid-ships, knowing better. They saw him dragging his sister after him,\\nas far as she could go, along the crowded deck, when he went to visit\\nhis patient--neither he, whose thoughts were occupied solely with\\nmatters of life and death, nor she, who was thinking entirely of him,\\nhaving any idea that the dark dormitory below, among the sailorsâ\\x80\\x99\\nhammocks, was an unfit place for her. It was Colin who stepped forward\\nto rescue the girl from this unnecessary trial: and Meredith gave her up\\nto him, with as little idea that this, too, was a doubtful expedient as\\nhe had of anything unsuitable in his original intention. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a\\nprivilege, if she but knew it,â\\x80\\x9d the invalid would say, fixing his hollow\\neyes on her, as if half doubtful whether he approved of her or not; and\\npoor Alice stayed behind him with a bad grace, without feeling much\\nindebted on her own account to her new friends. â\\x80\\x9cIt does not matter\\nwhere I go, so long as I am with him,â\\x80\\x9d she said, following him with her\\nanxious looks; and she remained there seated patiently upon her bench,\\nwith her eyes fixed on the spot where he had disappeared, until he\\nrejoined her. When Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s little prayer-meeting was ended, he came\\nwith a severe, and yet serene countenance towards the sister he had left\\nbehind, and the two friends who did not propose to accompany him. â\\x80\\x9cHe is\\na child of God,â\\x80\\x9d said the sick man; â\\x80\\x9chis experiences are a great comfort\\nto meâ\\x80\\x9d--and he looked with a little defiance at the companions, who, to\\nbe sure, so far as the carnal mind was concerned, could not but be more\\ncongenial to an educated man.\\n\\nHis new companions were indeed so interesting to Meredith, that the new\\nchapter of the â\\x80\\x9cVoice from the Graveâ\\x80\\x9d was all about Lauderdale and\\nColin. They were described under the initials L. and C., with a\\nheightening of all their valuable qualities, which was intended to make\\nmore and more apparent their want of â\\x80\\x9cthe one thing needful.â\\x80\\x9d They were\\nlike the rich young man whom Jesus loved, but who had not the heart to\\ngive up all and follow Him--they were like â\\x80\\x9chim who, through cowardice,\\nmade the great refusal--â\\x80\\x9d the sick man wrote without, however, quoting\\nDante; and he contrasted with their virtuous and thoughtful worldliness\\nthe condition of his convert, who knew nothing but the love of God, poor\\nMeredith said. Perhaps it was true that the sick sailor knew the love of\\nGod, and certainly the prayers of the volunteer missionary were not less\\nlikely to reach the ear of the Divine Majesty for being uttered by the\\npoor fellowâ\\x80\\x99s bedside. But, though he wrote a chapter in his book about\\nthem, Meredith still clung to his friends. The unseen and unknown were\\nfamiliar to their thoughts--perhaps even too familiar, being considered\\nby them as reasonably and naturally interesting; and poor Meredith was\\ndisposed to think that anything natural must be more or less wicked. But\\nstill he considered them interesting, and thought he might be able to do\\nthem good, and, for his own part, found all the human comfort he was\\ncapable of in their society. Thus it was that, with mutual compassions\\nand sympathy, he sorry for them and they for him, and mutual good\\noffices, the three grew into friendship hour by hour.\\n\\nAs for Alice, her brother was fond of her, but had never had his\\nattention specially attracted to her, nor been led to think of her as a\\ncompanion for himself. She was his tender little nurse and attendant--a\\ncreature with loving watchful eyes, and anxious little noiseless cares.\\nHe would have missed her terribly had she failed him, without quite\\nknowing what it was he missed. But, though he was in the habit of\\ninstructing her now and then, it did not occur to him to talk to his\\nsister. She was a creature of another species--an awakened soul, with\\nfew thoughts or feelings worth speaking of. At least such was the\\nestimate her brother had formed of her, and in which Alice herself\\nagreed to a great extent. It was not exactly humility that kept the\\nanxious girl in this mind, but an undisturbed habit and custom, out of\\nwhich no personal impulse had delivered her. The women of her kindred\\nhad never been remarkable one way or another. They were good women,\\nperfectly virtuous and a little tiresome, as even Alice was sensible;\\nand it had not been the custom of the men of the house to consult or\\nconfide in their partners. Her mother and aunts had found quite enough\\nto occupy them in housekeeping and needlework, and had accepted it as a\\nmatter of faith that men, except, perhaps, when in love, or in â\\x80\\x9ca\\npassion,â\\x80\\x9d did not care to talk to women--a family creed from which so\\nyoung and submissive a girl had not dreamt of enfranchising herself.\\nAccordingly she accepted quite calmly Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s low estimate of her\\npowers of companionship, and was moved by no injured feeling when he\\nsought the company of his new friends, and gave himself up to the\\npleasure of conversation. It was the most natural thing in the world to\\nAlice. She kept by him, holding by his arm when he and his companions\\nwalked about the deck together, as long as there was room for her; and,\\nwhen there was no room, she withdrew and sat down on the nearest seat,\\nand took out a little bit of needlework which never made any progress;\\nfor, though her intellect could not do Arthur any good, the anxious\\nscrutiny of her eyes could, or at least so she seemed to think.\\n\\nVery often, it was true, she was joined in her watch by Colin; of whom,\\nhowever, it never occurred to her to think under any other possible\\naspect than that of Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s friend. It might as well have been\\nLauderdale who shared her anxieties, so far as that went--for,\\nnotwithstanding a certain proclivity on the part of Colin to female\\nfriendship, Alice was too entirely unconscious, too utterly devoid of\\nany sense or feeling of self, to be interesting to the young man.\\nPerhaps a certain amount of self-regard is necessary to attract the\\nregard of others. Alice was not conscious of herself at all, and her\\ninsensibility communicated itself to her companion. He sometimes even\\nwondered if her intelligence was up to the ordinary level, and then felt\\nashamed of himself when by chance she lifted upon him her wistful eyes;\\nnot that those eyes were astonishingly bright, or conveyed any\\nintimations of hidden power--but they looked, as they were, unawakened,\\nsuggestive eyes, which might wake up at any moment and develop\\nunthought-of lights. But, on the whole, this twilight was too dim to\\ninterest Colin, except by moments; and it was incomprehensible and to\\nsome extent provoking and vexatious to the young man, to see by his side\\na creature so young, and with so many natural graces, who neutralized\\nthem all by her utter indifference to herself.\\n\\nSo that after all it came to be a very natural and reasonable step to\\naccompany the Merediths, to whose knowledge of the country and language\\neven Lauderdale found himself indebted when suddenly thrown without\\nwarning upon the tumultuous crowd of Leghorn boatmen, which was his\\nfirst foreign experience. â\\x80\\x9cThey all understand French,â\\x80\\x9d a benevolent\\nfellow-passenger said, as he went on before them; which did not give the\\nconsolation it was intended to convey to the two Scotch travellers, who\\nonly looked at each other sheepishly, and laughed with a very mixed and\\ndoubtful sort of mirth, not liking to commit themselves. They had to\\ngive themselves up blindly into the hands of Meredith and his\\nsister--for Alice felt herself of some importance in a country where she\\nâ\\x80\\x9cknew the languageâ\\x80\\x9d--and it was accordingly in the train of those two\\nthat Colin and Lauderdale were dragged along, like a pair of English\\ncaptives, through the very gates of Rome itself, and across the solemn\\nCampagna to the little city set upon a hill, to which the sick man was\\nbound. They made their way to it in a spring afternoon when the sun was\\ninclining towards the west, throwing long shadows of those long, weird,\\nendless arches of the Claudian aqueduct across the green wastes, and\\nshining full upon the white specks of scattered villages on the Alban\\nhills. The landscape would have been impressive even had it conveyed no\\nassociations to the minds of the spectators. But, as the reluctant\\nstrangers left Rome, they saw unfold before them a noble semicircle of\\nhills--the Sabines, blue and mysterious, on one side, the Latin range\\nbreaking bluntly into the centre of the ring, and towards the right hand\\nthe softer Alban heights with their lakes hidden in the hollows, and the\\nsunshine falling full upon their crest of towns. When they had mounted\\nthe steep ascent to Frascati, it was still more wonderful to look back\\nand see the sunset arranging itself over that great Campagna, falling\\ninto broad radiant bands of colour with inconceivable tints and\\nshadings, betraying in a sudden flash the distant sea, and shining all\\nmisty and golden over the dwarfed dome of St. Peterâ\\x80\\x99s, which rose up by\\nitself upon the distant plain with a wonderful insignificance of\\ngrandeur--all Rome around being blotted into oblivion. That would have\\nbeen a sight to linger over had not Meredith been weary and worn out,\\nand eager to get to his journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will see it often enough,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a little petulance;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cneither the sunset nor St. Peterâ\\x80\\x99s can run away:â\\x80\\x9d for it was to himself\\na sufficiently familiar sight. They went in accordingly to a large\\nhouse, which, a little to the disappointment of Colin, was just as\\nsquare and ugly as anything he could have found at home, though it stood\\nall the days and nights gazing with many eyes over that Campagna which\\nlooked like a thing to dream over for ever. It was the third storey of\\nthis house--- the upper floor--to which Meredith and his sister directed\\ntheir steps; Colin and Lauderdale following them--not without a little\\nexpectation, natural enough under the circumstances. It was cold, and\\nthey were tired, though not so much as the invalid; and they looked for\\na bright fire, a comfortable room, and a good meal--with a little\\ncuriosity, it is true, about the manner of it, but none as to the\\nblazing hearth and spread board, and all the other items indispensable\\nto comfort, according to English ideas. The room, when they got\\nadmittance, was very large, and full of windows, letting in a flood of\\nlight, which, as the sunshine was now too low to enter, was cold\\nlight--white, colourless, and chilling. Not a vestige of carpet was on\\nthe tiled floor, except before the fire-place, where a square piece of a\\ncurious coarse fabric and wonderful pattern had been laid down. A few\\nlogs were burning on the wide hearth, and close by was a little stack of\\nwood intended to replenish the fire. The great desert room contained a\\nworld of tables and hard uncushioned chairs, but the tired travellers\\nlooked in vain for the spread board which had pleased their imagination.\\nIf Colin had thought the house too like an ordinary ugly English house\\noutside to satisfy him, he found this abundantly made up for now by the\\ninterior, so unlike anything English; for the walls were painted with a\\nbrilliant landscape set in a frame of still more brilliant scarlet\\ncurtains, which the simple-minded artist had looped across his sky\\nwithout any hesitation; and underneath this gorgeous bit of fresco was\\nset a table against the wall, upon which were spread out a humble store\\nof little brown rolls, a square slice of butter, a basin full of eggs,\\nand a flask of oil--the humble provisions laid in by the attendant\\nMaria, who had rushed forward to kiss the young ladyâ\\x80\\x99s hand when she\\nopened the door. While the two inexperienced Scotch travellers stood\\nhorror-stricken, their companions, who were aware of what they were\\ncoming to, threw down their wraps and began to take possession, and to\\nsettle themselves in this extraordinary wilderness.\\n\\nMeredith for his part threw himself into a large primitive easy-chair\\nwhich stood by the fire. â\\x80\\x9cThis is a comfort I did not look for,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid; â\\x80\\x9cand, thank heaven, here we are at last.â\\x80\\x9d He drew a long breath of\\nsatisfaction as he stretched out his long meagre limbs before the fire.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome in and make yourselves comfortable. Alice will attend to\\neverything else,â\\x80\\x9d he said, looking back at his amazed companions, who,\\nfinding themselves in some degree his guests, had to subdue their\\nfeelings. They came and sat by him, exchanging looks of dismay--looks\\nwhich, perhaps, he perceived, for he drew in his long languid limbs, and\\nmade a little room for the others. â\\x80\\x9cMany things, of course, that are\\nnecessary in our severe climate are unnecessary here,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a\\nslight shiver; and, as he spoke, he reached out his hand for one of the\\nwraps he had thrown off, and drew it round his shoulders. This movement\\ngave a climax to the universal discomfort. Colin and Lauderdale once\\nmore looked at each other with mutual comments that could find no\\nutterance in words--the only audible expression of their mutual\\nsentiment being an exclamation of â\\x80\\x9cClimate!â\\x80\\x9d from the latter in an\\nundertone of unspeakable surprise and consternation. This, then, was the\\nItaly of which they had dreamed! The Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s parlour on the Holy Loch\\nwas, words could not tell how much warmer and more genial. The tired\\ntravellers turned towards the fire as the only possible gleam of\\nconsolation, and Meredith put out his long thin arm to seize another log\\nand place it on the hearth; even he felt the difference. He had done\\nnothing to help himself till he came here; but habits of indulgence\\ndropped off on the threshold of this Spartan dwelling. Colin repeated\\nwithin himself Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s exclamation, â\\x80\\x9cClimate!â\\x80\\x9d as he shivered in\\nhis chair. No doubt the invalid chair by the fire-side on the banks of\\nthe Holy Loch was a very different thing, so far as comfort was\\nconcerned.\\n\\nIn the meantime Alice found herself mistress of the position. Humble\\nlittle woman as she was, there came by moments, even to her, a\\ncompassionate contempt for the male creatures who got hungry and sulky\\nafter this fashion, and could only sit down ill-tempered and\\ndisconsolate before the fire. Alice for her part sent off Maria to the\\ntrattoria, and cheerfully prepared to feed the creatures who did not\\nknow how to set about it for themselves. When she had done her utmost,\\nhowever, there was still a look of dismay on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face. The dinner\\nfrom the trattoria was a thing altogether foreign to the experiences of\\nthe two Scotchmen. They suspected it while they ate, making secret wry\\nfaces to each other across the equivocal board. This was the land of\\npoets into which they had come--the land of the ideal, where, according\\nto their inexperienced imagination, everything was to share the general\\nrefinement! But, alas, there was nothing refined about the dinner from\\nthe trattoria, which was altogether a native production, and with which\\nthe Merediths, being accustomed, and knowing what they had to expect,\\ncontented themselves well enough. When Lauderdale and his charge\\nretired, chilled to the bone, to their stony, chilly bedrooms, where\\neverything seemed to convey not warmth but a sensation of freezing, they\\nlooked at each other with amazement and disgust on their faces.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCallant, you would have been twenty times better at home,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale with a remorseful groan; â\\x80\\x9cand as for thae poor innocents, who\\nhave nobody to look after them--But they kent what they were coming to,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe continued, with a flash of momentary anger. Altogether it was as\\nunsuccessful a beginning as could well be imagined of the ideal poetic\\nItalian life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX.\\n\\n\\nIt is impossible to deny that, except in hotels which are cosmopolitan,\\nand adapted to the many wants of the rich English, life in Italy is hard\\nbusiness enough for the inexperienced traveller, who knows the strange\\ncountry into which he has suddenly dropped rather by means of poetical\\nlegends than by the facts of actual existence. A country of vineyards\\nand orange-groves, of everlasting verdure and sunshine, is indeed, in\\nits way, a true enough description of one aspect of that many-sided\\ncountry: but these words of course convey no intimation of the terrors\\nof an Italian palace in the depth of winter, where everything is\\nstone-cold, and the possibilities of artificial warmth are of the most\\nlimited description; where the idea of doors and windows closely fitting\\nhas never entered the primitive mind, and where the cardinal virtue of\\npatience and endurance of necessary evils wraps the contented native\\nsufferer like the cloak which he hugs round him. Yet, notwithstanding,\\neven Lauderdale relaxed out of the settled gloom on his face when he\\nwent to the window of the great bare sitting-room, and gazed out upon\\nthe grand expanse of the Campagna, lighted up with morning sunshine. The\\nsilence of that depopulated plain, with its pathetic bits of ruin here\\nand there--ruins, to be sure, identified and written down in books, but\\nspeaking for themselves with a more woeful and suggestive voice than can\\nbe uttered by any mere historical associations, through the very depths\\nof their dumbness and loss of all distinction--went to the spectatorâ\\x80\\x99s\\nheart. What they were or had been, what human hands had erected, or\\nhuman hearts rejoiced in them, these lingering remains had ceased to\\ntell; and it was only with that vagueness which is sadder than any story\\nthat they indicated a former forgotten existence, a past too far away to\\nbe deciphered now.\\n\\nLauderdale laid his hand on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s shoulder, and drew him away. â\\x80\\x9cAy,\\nay,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with an unusual thrill in his voice, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s grand to hear\\nthat yonâ\\x80\\x99s Soracte, and thereaway is the Sabine country, and thatâ\\x80\\x99s Rome\\nlying away among the clouds. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no Rome, callant; itâ\\x80\\x99s a big kirk, or\\nheathen temple, or whatever you like to call it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no heeding about\\nRome. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the awfuâ\\x80\\x99 presence of the dead, and the skies smiling at\\nthem--thatâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 I see. Come away with me, and letâ\\x80\\x99s see if thereâ\\x80\\x99s ony\\nliving creatures left. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 thought to come into a manâ\\x80\\x99s head\\nin connexion with that bonnie innocent sky,â\\x80\\x9d the philosopher continued,\\nwith a slight shudder, as he drew his charge with him down the chilly\\nstaircase; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s aye bewildering to me to see the indifference of\\nNature. Itâ\\x80\\x99s terrible like as if she was a senseless heathen herselâ\\x80\\x99,\\nand cared nothing about nobody. No that Iâ\\x80\\x99m asserting that to be the\\ncase; but itâ\\x80\\x99s gruesome to look at her smiles and her wiles, as if she\\nkent no better. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no addicted to little bairns in a general way,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, drawing a long breath, as he emerged from the great door,\\nand suddenly found himself in the midst of a group of ragged little\\npicturesque savages; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s aye a comfort to see that thereâ\\x80\\x99s still\\nliving creatures left in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not for the living creatures, however, that people come to\\nItaly,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cStop here, and have another look at the Campagna. I\\nam not of your opinion about Nature. Sometimes tears themselves are less\\npathetic than a smile.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhere did _you_ learn that, callant?â\\x80\\x9d said his friend. â\\x80\\x9cBut thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nplenty of time for the Campagna, and I have aye an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 interest in\\nhuman folk. What do the little animals mean, raging like a set of little\\nfuries? Laddies, if youâ\\x80\\x99ve quarrelled fight it out like men, instead of\\nscolding like a parcel of fishwives,â\\x80\\x9d said the indignant stranger,\\naddressing himself to a knot of boys who were playing morra. When he\\nfound his remonstrance disregarded, Lauderdale seized what appeared to\\nhim the two ringleaders, and held them, one in each hand, with the\\napparent intention of knocking their heads together, entirely\\nundisturbed by the outcries and struggles of his victims, as well as by\\nthe voluble explanations of the rest of the party. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no use talking\\nnonsense to me,â\\x80\\x9d said the inexorable judge; â\\x80\\x9cthey shall either hold\\ntheir tongues, the little cowardly wretches, or they shall fight.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was, luckily, at this moment that Alice Meredith made her appearance,\\ngoing out to provide for the wants of her family like a careful little\\nhousewife. Her explanation filled Lauderdale with unbounded shame and\\ndismay. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an awful drawback no to understand the language,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, with a rush of burning colour to his face, for Lauderdale,\\nlike various other people, could not help entertaining an idea, in spite\\nof his better knowledge, that English (or what he was pleased to call\\nEnglish), spoken with due force and emphasis, was sure in the end to be\\nperfectly intelligible. Having received this painful lesson, he shrank\\nout of sight with the utmost discomfiture, holding Colin fast, who\\nbetrayed an inclination to accompany Alice. â\\x80\\x9cThis will never do; weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nhave to put to our hands and learn,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian. â\\x80\\x9cI never put\\nmuch faith before in that Babel business. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 humbling to be made\\na fool of by a parcel of bairns.â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale did not recover this\\nhumiliating defeat during the lengthened survey which followed of the\\nlittle town and its dependencies, where now and then they encountered\\nthe slight little figure of Alice walking alone, with a freedom\\npermitted (and wondered at) to the Signorina Inglese, who thus declared\\nher independence. They met her at the bakerâ\\x80\\x99s, where strings of\\nbiscuits, made in the shape of rings, hung like garlands about the door,\\nand where the little Englishwoman was using all her powers of persuasion\\nto seduce the master of the shop into the manufacture of _pane Inglese_,\\nbread made with yeast instead of leaven; and they met her again in the\\ndark vicinity of the trattoria, consulting with a dingy _traiteur_ about\\ndinner; though, fortunately for the success of the meal, the strangers\\nwere unaware that it was out of these dingy shades that their repast was\\nto come.\\n\\nThus the two rambled about, recovering their spirits a little as the\\nfirst glow of the Italian sunshine stole over them, and finding summer\\nin the bright piazza, though winter and gloom lingered in the narrow\\nstreets. Last of all they entered the cathedral, which was a place the\\ntwo friends approached with different feelings--Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind being full\\nof the curiosity of a man who was himself to be a priest, and who felt\\nto a certain degree that the future devotions and even government of his\\ncountry was in his hands. He was consequently quick to observe, and\\neven, notwithstanding the prejudices of education, not disinclined to\\nlearn, if anything worth learning was to be seen in the quiet country\\nchurch, where at present nothing beyond the ordinary services were going\\non. Lauderdale, in whose mind a lively and animated army of prejudices\\nwas in full operation, though met and crossed at every turn by an\\nequally lively belief in the truth of his fellow-creatures--which was a\\nsad drawback to his philosophy--went into the Frascati Cathedral with a\\ncurious mixture of open criticism and concealed respect, not unusual in\\na Scotchman. He was even ashamed of himself for his own alacrity in\\ntaking off his hat, as if one place could be holier than another; yet,\\nnevertheless, stowed his gaunt gigantic figure away behind the pillars,\\nand did what he could to walk softly, lest he should disturb the\\ndevotions of one or two kneeling women, who, however, paused with\\nperfect composure to look at the strangers without apparently being\\nconscious of any interruption. As for Colin, he was inspecting the\\narrangements of the cathedral at his leisure, when a sudden exclamation\\nfrom Lauderdale attracted his attention. He thought his friend had got\\ninto some new bewilderment, and hastened to join him, looking round\\nfirst, with the helplessness of a speechless stranger in a foreign\\ncountry, to see if there was anyone near who could explain for them in\\ncase of necessity. When, however, Colin had rejoined his companion, he\\nfound him standing rapt and silent before a tombstone covered with\\nlettering, which was placed against the wall of the church. Lauderdale\\nmade a curious unsteady sign, pointing to it, as Colin approached. It\\nwas a pompous Latin inscription, recording imaginary grandeurs which had\\nnever existed, and bearing the names of three British kings who never\\nreigned. Neither of the spectators who thus stood moved and speechless\\nbefore it had been brought up with any Jacobite tendencies--indeed,\\nJacobite ideas had died out of all reality before either of them was\\nborn,--but Lauderdale, Whig and sceptic as he was, uttered hoarsely out\\nof his throat the two words, â\\x80\\x9cPrince Chairlie!â\\x80\\x9d and then stood silent,\\ngazing at the stone with its pompous Latin lies and its sorrowful human\\nstory, as if it had been not an extinct family, but something of his own\\nblood and kindred which had lain underneath. Thus the two strangers went\\nout, subdued and silenced, from their first sight-seeing. It was not in\\nman, nor in Scotchman, to see the names and not remember all the\\nwonderful vain devotion, all the blind heroic efforts that had been made\\nfor these extinct Stuarts; and, with a certain instinctive loyalty,\\nreverential yet protesting, Colin and his friend turned away from\\nCharles Edwardâ\\x80\\x99s grave.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, after a long pause, â\\x80\\x9cthey were little to brag\\nof, either for wisdom or honesty, and no credit to _us_ that I can see;\\nbut it comes over a man with an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 strange sensation to fall suddenly\\nwithout any warning on the grave of a race that was once in such active\\nconnexion with his own. â\\x80\\x98Jacobus III., Carolus III., Henricus IX.â\\x80\\x99--is\\nthat how it goes? Itâ\\x80\\x99s terrible real, that inscription, though itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 a\\nfiction. They might be a feckless race; but, for aâ\\x80\\x99 that, it was awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nhard, when you think of it, upon Prince Chairlie. He was neither a fool\\nnor a liar, so far as I ever heard--which is more than you can say for\\nother members of the family; and he had to give way, and give up his\\nbirthright for thae miserable little wretches from Hanover. I dinna so\\nmuch wonder, when I think of it, at the â\\x80\\x9945. It was a pleasant\\nalternative for a country, callant, to choose between a bit Dutch idiot\\nthat knew nothing, and the son of her auld kings. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no speaking of\\nWilliam of Orange--heâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 overrated, and a cold-blooded devil, but\\naye a kind of a _man_ notwithstanding--but thae Hanover fellows-- And so\\nyonâ\\x80\\x99s Prince Chairlieâ\\x80\\x99s grave!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJust then Meredith, who had come out to bask in the sunshine, came up to\\nthem, and took, as he had learned to do, by way of supporting himself,\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s vigorous arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI forgot to tell you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cthat the Pretenderâ\\x80\\x99s grave was there.\\nI never enter these churches of Antichrist if I can help it. Life is too\\nshort to be wasted even in looking on at the wiles of the destroyer. Oh\\nthat we could do something to deliver these dying souls!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI saw little of the wiles of the destroyer for my part,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, abruptly; â\\x80\\x9cand, as for the Pretender, thereâ\\x80\\x99s many\\npretenders, and itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to tell which is the true. I know no\\nharm of Prince Chairlie, the little I do know of him. If it had been\\nmyselâ\\x80\\x99, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no free in my mind to say that I would have let go my\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s inheritance without striking a blow.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThese are the ideas of the carnal mind,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my friend,\\nif you would but be more serious! Does not your arrival in this country\\nsuggest to you another arrival which cannot be long delayed--which\\nindeed, for some of us at least, may happen any day,â\\x80\\x9d the sick man\\ncontinued, putting out his long thin hand to clasp that of Colin, who\\nwas on his other side. Lauderdale, who saw this gesture, started aside\\nwith a degree of violence which prevented the meeting of the two invalid\\nhands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI know little about this country,â\\x80\\x9d he said, almost with sullenness;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut I know still less about the other. Itâ\\x80\\x99s easy for you, callants, to\\nspeak. Iâ\\x80\\x99m real willing to make experiment of it, if that were\\npossible,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, softening; â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s no an ignorant soul\\nhereabouts that is more ignorant than me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us read together--let us consider it together,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cit\\nis all set down very plain, you know. He that runneth may read. In all\\nthe world there is nothing so important. My friend, you took pains to\\nunderstand about Italy--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd a bonnie business I made of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cdeluded by the\\nvery bairns; set right by one thatâ\\x80\\x99s little more than a bairn, that\\nlittle sister of yours; and now letting myself be drawn into\\ndiscussions! Iâ\\x80\\x99m twenty years, or near it, older than you are,â\\x80\\x9d he went\\non, â\\x80\\x9cand Iâ\\x80\\x99ve walked with them that have gone away _yonder_, as far as\\nflesh and blood would let me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no misdoubting anything thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwritten, callant, if that will satisfy you. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 darkness,\\nwith visions of white angels here and there; but the angels dinna\\nbelong to me. Whisht--whisht--Iâ\\x80\\x99m no profane; Iâ\\x80\\x99m wanting more--more\\nthan whatâ\\x80\\x99s written; and, as I cannot get that, I must even wait till I\\nsee for myself.--Hereâ\\x80\\x99s a grand spot for looking at your Campagna now,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said, breaking abruptly off; but poor Meredith, who had so little\\ntime to spare, and whose words had to be in season and out of season,\\ncould not consent to follow, as a man without so great a mission might\\nhave done, the leading of his companionâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Campagna is very interesting,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is nothing to the\\nsafety of your soul. Oh, my dear friend!--and here is Campbell, too, who\\nis not far from the kingdom of heaven. Promise me that you will come\\nwith me,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man. â\\x80\\x9cI shall not be able to stay long with\\nyou. Promise me that you will come and join me _there_!â\\x80\\x9d He put out his\\nthin arm, and raised it towards the sky, which kept smiling in its sunny\\ncalm, and took no note of these outbursts of human passion. â\\x80\\x9cI will wait\\nfor you at the golden gates,â\\x80\\x9d the invalid went on, fixing his hollow\\neyes first on one and then on another. â\\x80\\x9cYou will be my joy and crown of\\nrejoicing! You cannot refuse the prayer of a dying man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin, who was young, and upon whom the shadow of these golden gates was\\nhovering, held out his hand this time, touched to the heart. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\ncoming,â\\x80\\x9d he said, softly, almost under his breath, but yet loud enough\\nto catch the quick ear of Lauderdale, whose sudden movement displaced\\nMeredithâ\\x80\\x99s arm, which was clinging almost like a womanâ\\x80\\x99s to his own.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no for man to make any such unfounded promises,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale,\\nhoarsely; â\\x80\\x9cthough you read till your heartâ\\x80\\x99s sick, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing\\nwritten like _that_. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 imaginations, and yearnings, and dreams.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m no saying that it cannot be, or that it will not be, but I tell you\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s no such thing written; and, as far as I ken, or you ken, it may\\nbe aâ\\x80\\x99 delusion and disappointment. Whisht, whisht, callants! Dinna\\nentice each other out of this world, where thereâ\\x80\\x99s aye plenty to do for\\nthe like of you. Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying, Silence, sir!â\\x80\\x9d cried the philosopher, with\\nsudden desperation. And then he became aware that he had withdrawn the\\nsupport which Meredith stood so much in need of. â\\x80\\x9cA sober-minded man\\nlike me should have other company than a couple of laddies, with their\\nfancies,â\\x80\\x9d he said, in a hurried, apologetic tone; â\\x80\\x9cbut, as long as weâ\\x80\\x99re\\ntogether, you may as well take the good of me,â\\x80\\x9d he added, holding out\\nhis arm, with a rare, momentary smile. As for Meredith, for once in his\\nlife--partly because of a little more emotion than usual, partly because\\nhis weakness felt instantly the withdrawal of a support which had become\\nhabitual to him--he felt beyond a possibility of doubt that further\\nwords would be out of season just at that moment: and they resumed their\\nway a little more silently than usual. The road, like other Italian\\nroads, was marked by here and there a rude shrine in a niche in the\\nwall, or a cross erected by the wayside--neither of which objects\\npossessed in the smallest degree the recommendation of picturesqueness\\nwhich sentimental travellers attribute to them; for the crosses were of\\nthe rudest construction, as rude as if meant for actual use, and the\\npoor little niches, each with its red-eyed Madonna daubed on the wall,\\nsuggested no more idea of beauty than the most arbitrary symbol could\\nhave done. But Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s soul awoke within him when he saw the looks\\nwith which Colin regarded those shabby emblems of religious feeling. The\\nProtestant paused to regain his breath, and could keep silence no more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou look with interest at these devices of Antichrist,â\\x80\\x9d said the sick\\nman. â\\x80\\x9cYou think they promote a love of beauty, I suppose, or you think\\nthem picturesque. You donâ\\x80\\x99t think how they ruin the souls of those who\\ntrust in them,â\\x80\\x9d he said, eagerly and loudly; for they were passing\\nanother English party at that moment, and already the young missionary\\nlonged to accost them, and put his solemn questions about life and death\\nto their (presumably) careless souls.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey donâ\\x80\\x99t appear to me at all picturesque,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cand nobody\\nlooks at them that I can see except ourselves; so they canâ\\x80\\x99t ruin many\\nsouls. But you and I donâ\\x80\\x99t agree in all things, Meredith. The cross does\\nnot seem to me to come amiss anywhere. Perhaps the uglier and ruder it\\nis it becomes the more suggestive,â\\x80\\x9d the young man added, with a little\\nemotion. â\\x80\\x9cI should like to build a few crosses along our Scotch roads;\\nif anybody was moved to pray, I canâ\\x80\\x99t see what harm would be done; or,\\nif anybody was surprised by a sudden thought, it might be all the\\nbetter; even--one has heard of such a thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, whose heart\\nwas still a little out of its usual balance--â\\x80\\x9ca stray gleam of sunshine\\nmight come out of it here and there. If I was rich like some of your\\nGlasgow merchants, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d he said, laughing a little, â\\x80\\x9cI think,\\ninstead of a few fine dinners, Iâ\\x80\\x99d build a cross somewhere. I donâ\\x80\\x99t see\\nthat it would come amiss on a Scotch road--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you would think of something else than Scotch roads,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMeredith, with a little vexation; â\\x80\\x9cwhen I speak of things that concern\\nimmortal souls, you answer me with something about Scotland. What is\\nScotland to the salvation of a fellow-creature? I would rather that\\nScotland, or England either, was sunk to the bottom of the sea than\\nstand by and see a man dying in his sins.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe two Scotchmen looked at each other as he spoke; they smiled to each\\nother with a perfect community of feeling and motive, which conveyed\\nanother pang of irritation to the invalid who by nature had a spirit\\nwhich insisted upon being first and best beloved.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think we had better go home,â\\x80\\x9d he said abruptly, after a pause. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nknow Scotch pretty well, but I canâ\\x80\\x99t quite follow when you speak on\\nthese subjects. I want to have a talk with Maria about her brother, who\\nused to be very religiously disposed. Poor fellow, heâ\\x80\\x99s ill now, and\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve got something for him,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. Here he paused, and\\ndrew forth from his pocket a sheet folded like a map, which he opened\\nout carefully, looking first to see that there was nobody on the road.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey took them for maps at the dogana,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cand geography\\nis not prohibited--to the English at least; but this is better than\\ngeography. I mean to send it to poor Antonio, who can read, poor\\nfellow.â\\x80\\x9d The map, which was no map, consisted of a large sheet of paper,\\nintended apparently to be hung upon a wall, and containing the words,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,â\\x80\\x9d translated into\\nItalian. It was not without a little triumph that Meredith exhibited\\nthis effort at clandestine instruction. â\\x80\\x9cHe has to lie in bed,â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nwith a softened inflection of his voice; â\\x80\\x9cthis will console him and bear\\nhim company. It is a map of his future inheritance,â\\x80\\x9d the young\\nmissionary concluded, putting it back fondly into its deceitful\\nfolds;--and after this there was an uneasy pause, no one quite knowing\\nwhat to say.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou fight Antichrist with his own weapons, then,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cand do\\nevil that good may come,â\\x80\\x9d--and Lauderdale added his comment almost in\\nthe same breath--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThatâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fruitful principle if you once adopt it,â\\x80\\x9d he said;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s no telling where it may end. I would sooner leave the poor lad\\nin Godâ\\x80\\x99s hands, as no doubt he is, than smuggle in light to him after\\nthat fashion. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no fond of maps that are no maps,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ndissatisfied critic; by which time Colin had reloaded his guns, and was\\nready to fire.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is only a few words,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9ca man might keep such an\\nutterance in his memory without any necessity for double dealing. Do you\\nthink, for all the good it will do your patient to look at that text, it\\nis worth your while to risk him and yourself?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor myself I am perfectly indifferent,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith, glad of an\\nopportunity to defend himself. â\\x80\\x9cI hope I could take imprisonment\\njoyfully for the saving of a soul.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cImprisonment would be death to you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a touch of\\ncompunction, â\\x80\\x9cand would make an end of all further possibilities of use.\\nTo be thrown into a stony Italian prison at this season--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cfor my Masterâ\\x80\\x99s sake could I not bear more than\\nthat? If not, I am not worthy to call myself a Christian. I am ready to\\nbe offered,â\\x80\\x9d said the young enthusiast. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be an end beyond my\\nhopes to die like my Lord for the salvation of my brother. Such a\\nprophecy is no terror to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you two would but hold your tongues for five minutes at a time,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Lauderdale, with vexation, â\\x80\\x9cit would be a comfort. No doubt youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nboth ready enough to fling away your lives for any nonsensical idea that\\ncomes into your heads. But suppose we take the case of the other\\ninnocent callant, the Italian lad that aâ\\x80\\x99 this martyrdomâ\\x80\\x99s to be for. No\\nto say that itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 cheating--which my soul loathes,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nemphatic Scotchman--â\\x80\\x9cfigure to yourselves a wheen senseless women maybe,\\nor a wheen frightened priests, getting on the scent oâ\\x80\\x99 this heresy of\\nyours. Iâ\\x80\\x99m real reluctant to think that he would not get the same words,\\npoor callant, in his ain books without being torn to pieces for the sake\\nof a map that was not a map. Itâ\\x80\\x99s getting a wee chilly,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, â\\x80\\x9cand thereâ\\x80\\x99s a fire to be had in the house if nothing else.\\nCome in, callant, and no expose yourself; and you would put your grand\\nmap in the fire if you were to be guided by me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith these words of consolation on it!â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith, â\\x80\\x9cNever, if it\\nshould cost me my life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNae fear of its costing you your life; but I wouldna use even the\\nweapons of God after the devilâ\\x80\\x99s manner of fighting,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale,\\nwith a little impatience. â\\x80\\x9cAllowing you had aâ\\x80\\x99 the charge of saving\\nsouls, as you call it, and the Almighty Himself took no trouble on the\\nsubject, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no for using the sword oâ\\x80\\x99 the Spirit to give stabs in the\\ndark.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nJust then, fortunately, there came a seasonable diversion, which stayed\\nthe answer on Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s lips.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cArthur, we are going to dine early,â\\x80\\x9d said the voice of Alice just\\nbehind them; â\\x80\\x9cthe doctor said you were to dine early. Come and rest a\\nlittle before dinner. I met some people just now who were talking of Mr.\\nCampbell. They were wondering where he lived, and saying they had seen\\nhim somewhere. I told them you were with us,â\\x80\\x9d the girl went on, with the\\nair of a woman who might be Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother. â\\x80\\x9cWill you please come home\\nin case they should call?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis unexpected intimation ended the ramble and the talk, which was of a\\nkind rather different from the tourist talk which Colin had shortly to\\nexperience from the lips of his visitors, who were people who had seen\\nhim at Wodensbourne, and had been commissioned by the Franklands to look\\nfor him, and report upon his condition. Little Alice received the ample\\nEnglish visitors still with the air of being Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, or mature\\nprotecting female friend, and talked to the young lady daughter, who was\\nabout half as old again as herself, with an indulgent elderly kindness\\nwhich was beautiful to behold. There were a mother, father, daughter,\\nand two sons, moving about in a compact body, all of whom were\\nexceedingly curious about the quaint little brotherhood which, with\\nAlice for its protecting angel, had taken possession of the upper floor\\nof the Palazzo Savvielli. They were full of a flutter of talk about the\\nplaces they had visited, and of questions as to whether their new\\nacquaintances had been here or there. â\\x80\\x9cI promised Matty to write, and I\\nshall be sure to tell her I have seen you, and all about it,â\\x80\\x9d the young\\nlady said, playfully, not without a glance at Alice. Was it possible\\nthat this remark brought a little colour to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s cheek, or was it a\\nmere reflection from his own thoughts, throwing a momentary gleam across\\nher unimpassioned face? Anyhow, it occurred to Colin that the little\\nabstract Alice looked more like an ordinary girl of her years for the\\nfive minutes after the tourist party, leaving a wonderful silence and\\nsense of relief behind them, had disappeared down the chilly stone\\nstairs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI.\\n\\n\\nIt is not to be inferred from what has just been said that it had become\\na matter of importance to Colin how Alice Meredith looked. On the\\ncontrary, the relations between the two young people grew more distant,\\ninstead of becoming closer. It was Lauderdale with whom she talked\\nabout the domestic arrangements, which he and she managed together; and\\nindeed it was apparent that Alice, on the whole, had come to regard\\nColin, in a modified degree, as she regarded her brother--as something\\nto be taken care of, watched, fed, tended, and generally deferred to,\\nwithout any great possibility of comprehension or fellowship.\\nLauderdale, like herself, was the nurse and guardian of his invalid.\\nThough she lost sight of him altogether in the discussions which\\nperpetually arose among the three (which was not so much from being\\nunable to understand these discussions as from the conclusion made\\nbeforehand that she had nothing to do with them), it was quite a\\ndifferent matter when they fell into the background to consult what\\nwould be best for their two charges. There Alice was the superior, and\\nfelt her power. She talked to her tall companion with all the freedom of\\nher age, accepting his as that of a grandfather at least, to the\\namusement of the philosopher, to whom her chatter was very pleasant. All\\nthe history of her family (as he imagined) came unawares to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nears in this simple fashion, and more of Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s own mind and thoughts\\nthan she had the least idea of. He walked about with her as the lion\\nmight have done with Una, with a certain mixture of superiority and\\ninferiority, amusement and admiration. She was only a little girl to\\nLauderdale, but a delightsome thing in her innocent way; and, so far\\nfrom approving of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s indifference, there were times when he became\\nindignant at it, speculating impatiently on the youthful folly which did\\nnot recognise good fortune when it saw it. â\\x80\\x9cOf all women in the world\\nthe wife for the callant, if he only would make use of his een,â\\x80\\x9d\\nLauderdale said to himself; but so far from making use of his eyes, it\\npleased Colin, with the impertinence of youth, to turn the tables on his\\nMentor, and to indulge in unseasonable laughter, which sometimes had all\\nbut offended the graver and older man.\\n\\nAlice, however, whose mind was bent upon other things, was none the\\nwiser for this; and for her own part found â\\x80\\x9cMr. Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x9d of wonderful\\nservice to her. When they sat making up their accounts at the end of the\\nweek, Alice with her little pencil putting everything down in pauls and\\nscudi, which Lauderdale elaborately did into English money, as a\\npreliminary to the exact division of expenses which the two careful\\nhousekeepers made, the sight was pleasant enough. By times it occurred\\nthat Alice, dreadfully puzzled by her companionâ\\x80\\x99s Scotch, but bound in\\nchains of iron by her good breeding, which coming direct from the heart\\nwas of the most exquisite type, came stealing up to Colin, after a long\\ninterview with his friend, to ask the meaning of a word or two preserved\\nby painful mnemonic exercises in her memory; and she took to reading the\\nWaverley novels by way of assisting her in the new language; but, as the\\nonly available copies of these works were in the shape of an Italian\\ntranslation, it may be imagined that her progress was limited, and that\\nthe oral teaching was the most instructive.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Meredith lived on as best he could, poor fellow, basking in\\nthe sun in the middle of the day, and the rest of his time sitting close\\nto the fire with as many pillows and cloaks in his hard, old-fashioned\\neasy chair as might have sufficed for Siberia; and, indeed, it was a\\nkind of Siberian refuge which they had set up in the top floor of the\\nempty cold palace, which was used for a residence only during the hot\\nseason, and was adapted solely to the necessities of a blazing Italian\\nsummer. For the Italian winter--often so keen and penetrating, with its\\ncutting winds that come from the mountains, and those rapid and violent\\ntransitions which form the shadow to its sunshine--there, as elsewhere,\\nlittle provision had been made; and the surprise of the inexperienced\\ntravellers, who had come there for warmth and genial atmosphere, and\\nfound themselves suddenly plunged into a life of Spartan endurance--of\\ndeadly chill and iciness indescribable--has been already described. Yet\\nneither of them would consent to go into Rome, where comfort might be\\nhad by paying for it, and leave the brother and sister alone in this\\nchilly nest of theirs. So they remained together on their lofty perch,\\nlooking over the great Campagna, witnessing such sunsets and grandeurs\\nof cloud and wind as few people are privy to all their lifetime;\\nwatching the gleams of snow appear and disappear over the glorious\\npurple depths of the Sabine hills, and the sun shooting golden arrows\\ninto the sea; and gloom more wonderful still than the light, rolling on\\nlike an army in full march over that plain which has no equal. All these\\nthings they watched and witnessed, with comments of every description,\\nand with silence better than any comment. In themselves they were a\\nstrange little varied company; one of them, still in the middle of life,\\nbut to his own consciousness done with it, and watching the present\\nactors as he watched the sunsets; two of them full of undeveloped\\nprospects beginning the world which was so familiar and yet so unknown;\\nthe last of all making his way steadily with few delays into a world\\nstill more unknown--a world which they all by times turned to\\ninvestigate, with speculations, with questions, with enthusiastic\\nanticipation, with profound, child-like faith. Such was their life up\\namong the breezes, on the soft slopes of the Alban hills; and in the\\nmidst of everything more serious, of opening life and approaching death,\\nLauderdale and Alice sat down together weekly to reckon up their\\nexpenses in Italian and English money, and keep their accounts straight,\\nas the little housewife termed it, with the world.\\n\\nDuring this wintry weather, however, the occupations of the party were\\nnot altogether limited to these weekly accounts. Meredith, though a\\nlittle startled by the surprise shown by his companions at the too\\ningenious device of the map--which, after all, was not his device, but\\nthat of some Tract Society, or other body more zealous than\\nscrupulous--had not ceased his warnings, in season and out of season. He\\ntalked to Maria about dying in a way which inspired that simple woman to\\nthe unusual exertion of a pilgrimage to Vicovaro, where the kind Madonna\\nhad just been proved upon ample testimony to have moved her eyes, to the\\ngreat comfort and edification of the faithful. â\\x80\\x9cNo doubt it would be\\nmuch better to be walking about all day among the blessed saints in\\nheaven, as the Signor Arturo gives himself the trouble of telling me,â\\x80\\x9d\\nMaria said, with some anxiety in her face, â\\x80\\x9cbut _vedi, cara Signorina\\nmia_, it would be very inconvenient at the beginning of the season;â\\x80\\x9d\\nand, indeed, the same opinion was commonly expressed by Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s Italian\\nauditors, who had, for the most part, affairs on hand which did not\\nadmit of immediate attention to such a topic. Even the good-natured\\nfriars at Capo Croce declined to tackle the young Englishman after the\\nfirst accost; for they were all of opinion that dying was a business to\\nbe got over in the most expeditious manner possible, not to be dwelt on\\neither by unnecessary anxiousness before or lingering regret after; and,\\nas for the inevitable event itself, there were the last sacraments to\\nmake all right--though, indeed, the English invalid, _povero infelice_,\\nmight well make a fuss about a matter which must be so hopeless to him.\\nThis was all the fruit he had of his labours, there being at that time\\nno enterprising priest at hand to put a stop to the discussions of the\\nheretic. But, at the same time, he had Colin and Lauderdale close by,\\nand was using every means in his power to â\\x80\\x9cdo them good,â\\x80\\x9d as he said;\\nand still, in the quiet nights, when the cold and the silence had taken\\nentire possession of the great, vacant house and the half-frozen\\nvillage, poor Meredith, dragged his chair and his table closet to the\\nfire, and drew his cloak over his shoulders, and added yet another and\\nanother chapter to his â\\x80\\x9cVoice from the Grave.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs for Colin, if he had been a _littÃ¨rateur_ by profession, it is likely\\nthat, by this time, he would have began to compile â\\x80\\x9cLetters from Italy,â\\x80\\x9d\\nlike others of the trade; but, being only a Scotch scholar, the happy\\nholder of a Glasgow bursary, he felt himself superior to such\\ntemptations; though, indeed, after a weekâ\\x80\\x99s residence at Frascati, Colin\\nsecretly felt himself in a condition to let loose his opinion about\\nItalian affairs in general. In the meantime, however, he occupied\\nhimself in another fashion. Together, he and his watchful guardian made\\npilgrimages into Rome. They went to see everything that it was right to\\ngo to see; but, over and above that, they went into the churches--into\\nall manner of churches out of the way, where there were no grand\\nfunctions going on, but only every-day worship. Colin was not a watchful\\nEnglish divine spying upon the superstition of Rome, nor a rampant\\nProtestant finding out her errors and idolatries. He was the destined\\npriest of a nation in a state of transition and renaissance, which had\\ncome to feel itself wanting in the balance after a long period of\\nself-complacency. With the instinct of a budding legislator and the\\neagerness of youth, he watched the wonderful scene before him--not the\\nPope, with his peacock feathers, and purple and scarlet followers, and\\nwonderful audience of heretics--not high masses in great basilicas, nor\\nfine processions, nor sweet music. The two Scotsmen made part of very\\ndifferent assemblies in those Lenten days, and even in the joyful time\\nof Easter, when carriagefulls of English visitors, rushing to the\\nceremonies of the week, made the narrow Roman streets almost impassable.\\nPerhaps it was a feeling of a different kind which drew the two\\nstrangers for the first time to the awful and solemn temple, where once\\nthe heathen gods were worshipped, and where Raphael rests; but let\\nartists pardon Colin, whose own profession has associations still more\\nlofty than theirs, if, on his second visit, he forgot Raphael, and even\\nthe austere nobility of the place. A humble congregation of the\\ncommonest people about--people not even picturesque--women with shawls\\nover their heads, and a few of the dreamy poor old men who seem to spend\\ntheir lives about Italian churches, were dotted over the vast floor,\\nkneeling on those broken marbles which are as old as Christianity; some\\ndropped at random in the middle, beneath the wonderful blue breadth of\\nsky which looked in upon their devotions; some about the steps of the\\nlittle altars round, and a little group at the special shrine where\\nvespers were being sung. A lover of music would not have found a voice\\nworth listening to in the place, and perhaps neither time nor tune was\\nmuch attended to; but there was not a soul there, from the faint old men\\nto the little children, who did not, according to his capabilities, take\\nup the response, which was to every one, apparently, matter as familiar\\nas an every-day utterance. These worshippers had no books, and did not\\nneed any. It might be words in a dead language--it might be but\\npartially understood, or not understood at all; but at least it was\\nknown and familiar as no religious service is in England,\\nnotwithstanding all our national vaunt of the prayer-book, and as\\nnothing could possibly be in Scotland, where we have no guide (save â\\x80\\x9cthe\\nministerâ\\x80\\x9d) to our devotion. When Colin, still weak and easily fatigued,\\nwithdrew a little, and sat down upon the steps of the high altar to\\nlisten, with a kind of shame in his heart at being unable to join those\\nuniversal devotions, there came to his ear a wonderful chime of echoes\\nfrom the great dome, which sent his poetic heart astray in spite of\\nitself--for it sounded to the young dreamer like another unseen choir up\\nthere, who could tell of what spectators and assistants?--wistful voices\\nof the past, coming back to echo the Name which was greater than that of\\nJove or Apollo. And then he returned to his legislative thoughts; to his\\ndreams, patriotic and priestly: to his wondering, incredulous question\\nwith himself whether worship so familiar and so general, so absolutely a\\npart of their daily existence, could ever be known to his own people.\\nSuch a thought, no doubt, had it been known, would almost have warranted\\nthe withdrawal of the scholarship, and certainly would have deferred\\nindefinitely Colinâ\\x80\\x99s chances of obtaining licence from any Scotch\\nPresbytery. But, fortunately, Presbyterians are little interested in\\ninvestigating what takes place in the Pantheon at Rome;--whether old\\nAgrippa breathes a far-off Amen out of the dome of his dead magnificence\\nto the worship of the Nazarene, as Colin thought in his dreams; or what\\nvain imaginations may possess the soul of a wandering student there. He\\nwas roused abruptly out of these visions by the English party who had\\nvisited him at Frascati, and who came up to salute him now with that\\nfrank indifference to other people for which our nation is said to be\\npre-eminent. They shook hands with him all round, for they were\\nacquainted with his story, and Colin was of the kind of man to make\\npeople interested in him; and then they began to talk.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA sad exhibition this, is it not, Mr. Campbell?â\\x80\\x9d said the mother; â\\x80\\x9cone\\nforgets how dreadful it is, you know, when one sees it in all its\\ngrandeur--with fine music, and silver trumpets, and so forth; but it is\\nterrible to see all these poor creatures, and to think they know no\\nbetter. Such singing! There is not a charity school at home that would\\ndo so badly; and they speak of music in Italy!â\\x80\\x9d said the English matron,\\nwho indeed in her last observation had some truth on her side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was young, and not above saying a fine thing\\nwhen he could; â\\x80\\x9clisten to the echo. Are there some kind angels in the\\ndome, do you think, to mend the music? or is it the poor old heathens\\nwho hang about for very wistfulness, and say as good an Amen as they\\ncan, poor souls? Listen; I have heard no music like it in Rome.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Campbell, what a beautiful idea!â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady; and\\nthen, the service being ended, they walked about a little, and looked up\\nfrom the centre of the place to the blue wintry sky, which forms the\\nliving centre of that vault of ages--an occupation which Lauderdale\\ninterrupted hurriedly enough by reminding Colin that they had still to\\nget out to Frascati, and were already after time.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh! you still live in Frascati,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s acquaintance, â\\x80\\x9cwith that\\nvery strange young man? I never spoke to anybody in my life who startled\\nme so much. Do you happen to know if he is a son of that very strange\\nMr. Meredith, whom there was so much talk of last year? that man, you\\nknow, who pretended to be so very good, and ran away with somebody. Dear\\nme, I thought everybody knew that story. His son was ill, I know, and\\nlived abroad. I wonder if it is the same.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think my friend has any father,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who, stimulated by\\nthe knowledge that the last train would start in half an hour, was\\nanxious to get away.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, well, I hope so, I am sure, for your sake; for _that_ Mr. Meredith\\nwas a dreadful man, and pretended to be _so_ good till he was found\\nout,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady. â\\x80\\x9cSomething Hall was the name of his place. Let me\\nrecollect. Dear me, does nobody know the name?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood-bye; it is our time,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, and he obeyed the gesture of\\nLauderdale, and rushed after his already distant figure; but, before he\\nhad turned the corner of the square, one of the sons overtook him. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nbeg your pardon, but my mother wishes you to know that it was Meredith\\nof Maltby she was talking of just now,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man out of\\nbreath. Colin laughed to himself as he hastened after his friend. What\\nhad he to do with Meredith of Maltby? But, as he dashed along, he began\\nto recollect an ugly story in the papers, and to bethink himself of a\\ncertain odd prejudice which he had been conscious of on first hearing\\nthe name of the brother and sister. When he got near enough to\\nLauderdale to lay hold of his arm, Colin could not help uttering, as was\\nusual to him, what was at present on the surface of his mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou know all about them,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cdo you think they have a father?â\\x80\\x9d\\nwhich simple words were said with a few gasps, as he was out of breath.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s the use of coming after me like a steam-engine?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cdid you think I would run away? and youâ\\x80\\x99ve need of aâ\\x80\\x99 your\\nbreath for that weary brae. How should I ken all about them? Theyâ\\x80\\x99re\\nyour friends, and not mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll very well, Lauderdale; but she never makes _me_ her confidant,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the young man, with his usual laugh.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no canny to speak of _she_,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nsuggestive, and no a word for either you or me. She has an aunt in\\nIndia, and two uncles that died in the Crimea, if you want to know\\nexactly. That is all she has ever told to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd with this they dismissed the subject from their minds, and,\\narm-in-arm, addressed themselves to the arduous task of getting to the\\nstation through the narrow crowded streets in time for the train.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\n\\nThe fatigue of sight-seeing, wound up by a frantic rush to the railway\\nto be in time for the train, which after all was a train quite at\\nleisure, as most passengers are in Italy, was too much for the early\\nbudding of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s strength, and laid him up for a day or two, as was\\nonly natural; an occurrence which had a curious effect upon the little\\nhousehold. To Lauderdale it was a temporary return into those mists of\\ndespair which, partly produced by the philosopherâ\\x80\\x99s own sad experience,\\nhad made him at first come to so abrupt a conclusion touching Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nchances of life. When he saw him once more prostrated, Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s\\npatience and courage alike gave way. He became like a man in a sinking\\nship, who has not composure to await the end which is naturally at hand,\\nbut flings himself into the sea to meet it. He talked wildly of going\\nhome, and bitterly of the utter privation of comfort to which his\\ninvalid was exposed; and his heart was closed for the moment even to the\\napproaches of Alice. â\\x80\\x9cIf it hadna been for you!â\\x80\\x9d he said within his\\nclenched teeth, turning away from her; and was not safe to speak to for\\nthe moment. But, oddly enough, the effect of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s illness upon the\\nothers was of an entirely different character. Instead of distressing\\nMeredith and his sister, it produced, by some wonderful subtle action\\nwhich we do not pretend to explain, an exhilarating effect upon them. It\\nseemed to prove somehow, to Alice especially, that illness was a general\\nevil distributed over all the world; that it was a usual thing for young\\nmen to be reduced to weakness and obliged to be careful of themselves.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Campbell, you see, is just the same as Arthur. It is a great deal\\ncommoner than one thinks,â\\x80\\x9d the poor little girl said to Sora Antonia,\\nwho had charge of the house; and though her feelings towards Colin were\\nof the most benevolent and even affectionate description, this thought\\nwas a sensible consolation to her. Meredith regarded the matter from a\\ndifferent point of view. â\\x80\\x9cI have always hoped that he was one of the\\nchosen,â\\x80\\x9d the invalid said when he heard of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s illness; â\\x80\\x9cbut I\\nfeared that God was leaving him alone. We always judge His ways\\nprematurely even when we least intend it. We ought to thank God that our\\ndear friend is feeling His hand, and is subject to chastisements which\\nmay lead him to Christ.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCallant,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale fiercely, â\\x80\\x9cspeak of things ye understand;\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s not for you to interfere between a man and his Maker. A soul more\\nlike Him of whom you dare to speak never came out of the Almightyâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhands. Do you think God is like a restless woman and never can be done\\nmeddling?â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian, betrayed out of his usual\\nself-restraint; but his own heart was trembling for his charge, and he\\nhad not composure enough to watch over his words. As for the sick man,\\nwhose own malady went steadily on without any great pauses or sudden\\nincrease, he lifted his dying eyes and addressed himself eagerly, as he\\nwas wont, to his usual argument.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf any man can understand it, I should,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cCannot I trace\\nthe way by which He has led _me_?--a hard way to flesh and blood. Cannot\\nI see how He has driven me from one stronghold after another, leaving me\\nno refuge but in Christ? And, such being the case, can you wonder that I\\nshould wish the same discipline for my friend? The only thing I should\\nfear for myself is restoration to health; and are you surprised that I\\nshould fear it for him?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not surprised at anything but my ain idiocy in having my hand in\\nthe matter,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; and he went away abruptly to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s room\\nwith a horrible sense of calamity and helplessness. There was something\\nin Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s confident explanation of Godâ\\x80\\x99s dealings which drove him\\nhalf frantic, and filled him with an unreasonable panic. Perhaps it was\\ntrue; perhaps those lightnings in the clouds had been but momentary--a\\nfalse hope. When, however, with his agitation so painfully compressed\\nand kept under that it produced a morose expression upon his grave face,\\nhe went into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s room, he found his patient sitting up in bed, with\\nhis great-coat over his shoulders, writing with a pencil on the fly-leaf\\nof the book which his faithful attendant had given him to â\\x80\\x9ckeep him\\nquiet.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNever mind,â\\x80\\x9d said the disorderly invalid. â\\x80\\x9cI am all right, Lauderdale.\\nGive us pen and ink, like a kind soul. You donâ\\x80\\x99t imagine I am ill,\\nsurely, because I am lazy after last night?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve given up imagining anything on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s grim\\nguardian. â\\x80\\x9cWhen a man in his senses sets up house with a parcel of\\nlunatics itâ\\x80\\x99s easy to divine what will come of it, lie down in your bed\\nand keep quiet, and get well again; or else get up,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale,\\ngiving vent to a sharp acrid sound as if he had gnashed his teeth, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nlet us be done with it all, and go home.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt this Colin opened his great brown eyes, which were as far from being\\nanxious or depressed as could well be conceived, and laughed softly in\\nhis companionâ\\x80\\x99s face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis comes of Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s talk, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cand of course it\\nhas been about me, or it would not have riled you. How often have you\\ntold me that you understood the state of mind which produced all that?\\nHe is very good at the bottom, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s a good\\nfellow, give me my little writing-case. I want to write it out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou want to write what out?â\\x80\\x9d asked Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cSome of your nonsense\\nverses? Iâ\\x80\\x99ll give you no writing-case. Lie down in your bed and keep\\nyourself warm.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fond of looking at your ain productions.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve no doubt its terrible rubbish if a man could read it. Letâ\\x80\\x99s see the\\nthing. Do you think a parcel of verses in that halting _In Memoriam_\\nmetre--Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying anything against _In Memoriam_--but if _I_ set up\\nfor a poet, I would make a measure for myselâ\\x80\\x99--are worth an illness?\\nand the cold of this wretched place is enough to kill ony rational man.\\nEetaly! I wouldna send a dog here, to be perished with cold and hunger.\\nDo what I tell you, callant, and lie down. It shows an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 poverty of\\ninvention, that desire to copy everything out.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cyou donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose it is for myself. I want to give\\nit to somebody,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man with a conscious smile. And to look\\nat him with his countenance all a-glow, pleasure and fun and affection\\nbrightening his eyes, and his face lighted up with the gentle commotion\\nof thought which had ended in that writing of verses, it was hard to\\nthink of him as a man whom God for a solemn purpose had weighted with\\naffliction--as he had appeared in Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. Rather he looked,\\nwhat he was, one of Godâ\\x80\\x99s most joyful and gifted creatures; glad without\\nknowing why; glad because the sweet imaginations of youth had possession\\nof him, and filled heaven and earth with brave apparitions. Love and\\nanxiety had introduced into the heart of Lauderdale, so far as Colin was\\nconcerned, a certain feminine element--and he laughed unsteadily out of\\na poignant thrill of relief and consolation, as he took the book from\\nhis patientâ\\x80\\x99s hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s no a callant that can do without an audience,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand, seeing itâ\\x80\\x99s poetry thatâ\\x80\\x99s in question, no doubt itâ\\x80\\x99s a female\\naudience thatâ\\x80\\x99s contemplated. You may spare yourself the trouble, Colin.\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s bonnie, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s good; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no free to say that I donâ\\x80\\x99t like\\nher all the better for caring for none of these things; but I see no\\ntoken that sheâ\\x80\\x99ll ever get beyond Wattsâ\\x80\\x99s hymns all her days. You needna\\ntrouble your head about writing out things for her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Colin reddened a little, and said â\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d and made a long\\ngrasp at the writing-case--which exertion cost him a fit of coughing.\\nLauderdale sat by his side gloomily enough all day, asking himself\\nwhether the colour was hectic that brightened Colinâ\\x80\\x99s cheeks, and\\nlistening to the sound of his breathing and the ring of his voice with\\nindescribable pangs of anxiety. When evening came the watcher had\\nconsiderably more fever than the patient, and turned his eyes abroad\\nover the Campagna, with a gaze which saw nothing glorious in the scene.\\nAt that moment, the sun going down in grandeur over the misty distance,\\nwhich was Rome--the wonderful belts and zones of colour in the vault of\\nsky which covered in that melancholy waste with its specks of ruin--were\\nnothing in Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes in comparison with the vision that haunted\\nhim of a cosy homely room in a Scotch farmhouse, full of warm glimmers\\nof fire light and humble comforts. â\\x80\\x9cHe would mend if he were but at\\nhome,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself almost with bitterness, turning his eyes from\\nthe landscape without, to which he was indifferent, to the bare white\\nstony walls within. He was so cold sitting there, he who was well and\\nstrong, that he had put on his great-coat. And it was for this he had\\nbrought the youth whom he loved so far away from those â\\x80\\x9cwho belonged to\\nhim!â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale thought with a pang of the Mistress, and what she would\\nsay if she could see the comfortless place to which she had sent her\\nboy. Meanwhile the patient who caused so much anxiety, was, for his own\\npart, very comfortable, and copied out his verses with a care that made\\nit very apparent he had no intention of coming to a speedy end, either\\nof life or its enjoyments. He had not written anything for a long time,\\nand the exercise was pleasant to him--and when it was done he lay back\\non his pillows, and took the trouble to remark to Lauderdale upon the\\ndecorations of the poor bare stony chamber which the philosopher was\\ncursing in his heart.--â\\x80\\x9cWe are before them in some things,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nreflectively, â\\x80\\x9cbut they beat us in a great many. See how simply that\\neffect is obtained--just a line or two of colour, and yet nothing could\\nbe more perfect in its way.â\\x80\\x9d To which observation Lauderdale responded\\nonly by an indescribable growl, which provoked the laughter of his\\nunruly patient. The next remark Colin made was, however, received with\\ngreater favour, for he asked plaintively if it was not time for\\ndinner--a question more soothing to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s feelings than volumes\\nof remonstrances. He carried Colinâ\\x80\\x99s portion into the room when that\\nmeal arrived from the Trattoria, scorning female assistance, and\\narranging everything with that exquisite uncouth tenderness which,\\nperhaps, only a woman could do full justice to; for the fact is, that\\nColin, though ravenously hungry, and fully disposed to approve of the\\nrepast, had a momentary thought that it would have been ever so much\\npleasanter to have been served by the little housekeeper herself.\\n\\nWhen the darkness had hushed and covered up the Campagna, and stilled\\nall the village sounds, Lauderdale himself, a little flushed from an\\naddress he had just been delivering to Meredith, went in and looked at\\nthe sleeping face which was so precious to him, and tortured himself\\nonce more with questions whether it might be fever which gave colour to\\nthe young manâ\\x80\\x99s cheek. But Colin, notwithstanding his cold, was\\nbreathing full long breaths, with life in every inspiration, and his\\nfriend went not uncomforted to bed.\\n\\nBut while Colin lay thus at rest, Meredith had resumed his writing, and\\nwas working into his current chapter the conversation which had just\\ntaken place. â\\x80\\x9cThe worldly man asks if the afflictions of the just are\\nsigns of favouritism on Godâ\\x80\\x99s part,â\\x80\\x9d wrote the young author, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nappeals to us whether a happy man is less beloved of his Father than I\\nam who suffer. He virtually contradicts scripture, and tells me that the\\nLord does _not_ scourge every son whom He receiveth. But I say, and the\\nHoly Bible says with me, Tremble, oh ye who are happy--our troubles are\\nGodâ\\x80\\x99s tokens of love and mercy to our souls.â\\x80\\x9d As he wrote this, the\\nyoung eyes, which were so soon to close upon life, brightened and\\nexpanded with a wonderful glow. His mind was not broad nor catholic, nor\\ncapable of perceiving the manifold diversity of those ways of God which\\nare beyond the comprehension of men. He could not understand how, upon\\nthe last and lightest labourer, the Master of the vineyard might bestow\\nthe equal hire; and--taking that as the hardest labour which fell to his\\nown share--was bent at least on making up for it by the most supreme\\ncompensation. And, indeed, it was hard to blame him for claiming, by way\\nof balance to his afflictions, a warmer and closer share in the love of\\nGod. At least, that was no vulgar recompense. As for the â\\x80\\x9cworldly manâ\\x80\\x9d\\nof Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s paragraph, he, too, sat a long while in his chamber, not\\nwriting, but pondering--gazing into the flame of the tall Roman lamp on\\nhis table as if some solution of the mysteries in his thoughts was to be\\nfound in its smoky light. To identify Lauderdale in the character of a\\nworldly man would have been difficult enough to any one who knew him;\\nyet, to Meredith, he had afforded a perfect example of â\\x80\\x9ccarnal\\nreasoning,â\\x80\\x9d and the disposition which is according to the flesh, and not\\naccording to the Spirit. This worldly-minded individual sat staring into\\nthe lamp, even after his young critic had ceased to write--revolving\\nthings that he could see were about to happen, and things which he\\ndreaded without being able to see; and more than all wondering over that\\nawful mystery of Providence to which the young invalid gave so easy a\\nsolution. â\\x80\\x9cIt wouldna be so hard to make out if a man could think he was\\nless loved than his fellows, as they thought lang-syne,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale\\nto himself, â\\x80\\x9cor more loved, as, twisting certain scriptures, itâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nfashion to say now; but its awfuâ\\x80\\x99 ill to understand such dealings in Him\\nthat is the Father of all, and makes nae favourites. Poor Callant! itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlike heâ\\x80\\x99ll be the first to find the secret out.â\\x80\\x9d And, as he pondered, he\\ncould not restrain a groan over the impending fate which threatened\\nMeredith, and on the complications that were soon to follow. To be sure,\\nhe had nothing particular to do with it, however it might happen; but\\nevery kind of Christian tenderness and charity lurked in the heart of\\nthe homely Scotch philosopher who stood in Arthur Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s last\\nchapter as the impersonation of the worldly man.\\n\\nNext day Colin reappeared, to the astonishment of the brother and\\nsister. Let us not say, to their disappointment--and yet poor little\\nAlice, underneath her congratulations, said to herself with a pang, â\\x80\\x9cHe\\nhas got well--they all get well but Arthur;â\\x80\\x9d and, when she was aware of\\nthe thought, hated herself, and wondered wistfully whether it was\\nbecause of her wickedness that her prayers for Arthur were not heard.\\nAnxiety and even grief are not the improving influences they are\\nsometimes thought to be--and it is hard upon human nature to be really\\nthankful for the benefits which God gives to others, passing over oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nself. Meredith, who was the sufferer in his own person, could afford to\\nbe more generous. He said, â\\x80\\x9cI am glad you are betterâ\\x80\\x9d with all his\\nheart; and then he added--â\\x80\\x9cThe Lord does not mean to leave you alone,\\nCampbell. Though He has spared you, He still continues His warnings. Do\\nnot neglect them, I beseech you, my dear friendâ\\x80\\x9d--before he returned to\\nhis writing. He was occupied now day and night with his â\\x80\\x9cVoice from the\\nGrave.â\\x80\\x9d He was less able to walk, less able to talk, than he had been,\\nand now, as the night came fast in which no man can work, was devoting\\nall his time and all his feeble strength to this last message to the\\nworld.\\n\\nIt would have been pitiful enough to any indifferent spectator to note\\nthe contrast between the sick manâ\\x80\\x99s solemn labour apart, and the glow of\\nsubdued pleasure in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face as he drew his seat in the evening\\ntowards the table which Alice had chosen for herself. The great bare\\nroom had so much space and so many tables, and there was so large a\\nstock of lamps among the movables of the house, that each of the party\\nhad a corner for himself, to which (with his great-coat on or otherwise)\\nhe could retire when he chose. The table of Alice was the central point;\\nand as she sat with the tall antique lamp throwing its primitive\\nunshaded light upon her, still and graceful with her needlework, the\\nsight of her was like that of a supreme _objet de luxe_ in the otherwise\\nbare apartment. Perhaps, under due protection and control, the presence\\nof womankind, thus calm, thus silent--letting itself, as the old maxim\\ncommanded, be seen and not heard--is to men of sober mind and middle\\nage--such as Lauderdale, for example--the most agreeable ornament with\\nwhich a room could be provided. Younger individuals might prefer that\\nthe tableau should dissolve, and the impersonation of womankind melt\\ninto an ordinary woman. Such at least was the feeling of Colin. She was\\nvery sweet to look at; but, if she had descended from her pedestal, and\\ntalked a little and laughed a little, and even perhaps--but the idea of\\nanything like flirtation on the part of Alice Meredith was too absurd an\\nidea to be entertained for a moment. However, abstracted and preoccupied\\nas she was; she was still a woman young and fair--and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s voice\\nsoftened and his eyes brightened as he drew his chair to the other side\\nof the lamp, and looked across the table at her soft, downcast face. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nhave something here I want you to look at,â\\x80\\x9d said the young poet, who had\\nbeen used to Matty Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s sympathy and curiosity; â\\x80\\x9cnot that it is\\nmuch worth your while; but Lauderdale told you that writing verses was a\\nweakness of mine,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, with, a youthful blush and smile. As for\\nAlice, she took the paper he gave her, looking a little frightened, and\\nheld it for a moment in her hand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, thank you, Mr. Campbell; am I to read it?â\\x80\\x9d she said, with puzzled,\\nuncertain looks. Naturally enough she was perplexed and even frightened\\nby such an address; for, as Lauderdale said, her knowledge of poetry was\\nconfined to hymns, over which hung an awful shadow from the â\\x80\\x9cParadise\\nLost.â\\x80\\x9d She opened Colinâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ccopy of versesâ\\x80\\x9d timorously as she spoke, and\\nglanced at them, and stumbled at his handwriting, which, like most other\\npeopleâ\\x80\\x99s in these, scribbling days, was careless and indistinct. â\\x80\\x9cI am\\nsure it is very pretty,â\\x80\\x9d faltered Alice as she got to the end of the\\npage; and then, more timidly still, â\\x80\\x9cWhat am I to do with it, Mr.\\nCampbell?â\\x80\\x9d asked the poor girl. When she saw the sudden flush that\\ncovered his face, Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s slumbering faculties were wakened up by the\\nsharp shock of having given pain--which was a fault which she had very\\nseldom consciously committed in the course of her innocent life.\\n\\nColin was too much a gentleman to lose his temper; but it is impossible\\nto deny that the effort which he made to keep it was a violent one, and\\nrequired all his manhood. â\\x80\\x9cKeep it if you like it,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a\\nsmile which thinly covered his mortification; â\\x80\\x9cor put it in the fire if\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t.â\\x80\\x9d He said this as philosophically as was possible under the\\ncircumstances. And then he tried a little conversation by way of proving\\nhis perfect composure and command of his feelings, during which poor\\nAlice sat fluttered and uncomfortable and self-conscious as she had\\nnever been before. Her work was at an end for that night at least. She\\nheld Colinâ\\x80\\x99s little poem in her hand, and kept her eyes upon it, and\\ntried with all her might to invent something gracious and complimentary\\nwhich could be said without offence; for, of course, carefully as he\\nimagined himself to have concealed it, and utterly unconscious of the\\nfact as Lauderdale remained, who was watching them, Alice was as\\nentirely aware of the state of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind and temper at the moment as\\nhe was himself. After a while he got up and went to Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s table by\\nthe fire; and the two began to talk, as Alice imagined, of matters much\\ntoo serious and momentous to leave either at leisure to remark her\\nmovements. When she saw them thus occupied she left the room almost\\nstealthily, carrying with her the tall lamp with its four tongues of\\nflame. She set down her light in her own room when she reached that\\nsanctuary, and once more read and pored over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s poem. There was\\nnothing about love in it, and consequently nothing improper or alarming\\nto Alice. It was all about the Pantheon and its vespers, and the echoes\\nin the dome. But then why did he give it to her? why did he look so much\\ndisturbed when she in her surprise and unreadiness hesitated over it?\\nSuch an offering was totally new to Alice: how could she be expected to\\nunderstand exactly how it ought to be received? But it is impossible to\\ndescribe how vexed and mortified she was to find she had failed of what\\nwas expected of her, and inflicted pain when she might have given\\npleasure. She had been rude, and to be rude was criminal in her code of\\nmanners; and a flutter of other questions, other curiosities, awoke\\nwithout any will of her own in the young creatureâ\\x80\\x99s maiden bosom; for,\\nindeed, she was still very young, not nineteen, and so preoccupied by\\none class of thoughts that her mind had been absolutely barred against\\nall others until now.\\n\\nThe end was that Alice put away Colinâ\\x80\\x99s poem in the private pocket of\\nher writing-case, the very innermost of her sanctuaries. â\\x80\\x9cHow clever he\\nis,â\\x80\\x9d she thought to herself; â\\x80\\x9chow odd that such things should come into\\nany oneâ\\x80\\x99s head; and to think I had not even the civility to say that it\\nwas beautiful poetry!â\\x80\\x9d Then she went back very humbly into the\\nsitting-room, and served Colin with the last cup of tea, which was the\\nmost excellent. â\\x80\\x9cFor I know you like strong tea, Mr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid, looking at him with appealing eyes. â\\x80\\x9cIt feels quite strange to\\nthink that we should know you so well--you who can write such beautiful\\npoetry,â\\x80\\x9d[1] she managed to say later in the evening. â\\x80\\x9cI have always\\nsupposed a poet so different.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWith wings, perhaps?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was not displeased even with this\\nsimple testimony.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh no,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, â\\x80\\x9cthat is impossible, you know--but certainly very\\ndifferent; and it was so very kind to think of giving it to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus she made her peace with the young man--but it is doubtful how far\\nshe promoted her own by so doing. It introduced a new element of wonder\\nand curiosity, if nothing more, into her watching life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would be a great satisfaction to me,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cto have some\\nunderstanding about their relations. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s few folk so lonely in this\\nworld but what they have some kin, be they kind or not. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 to\\nlook at this poor bit thing, and think how forlorn sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be by and by,\\nwhen----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin--â\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean? Meredith is not worse that I can\\nsee. Is _that_ what you are thinking of?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 gradual descent,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cnae precipices\\nthere--and pitiful to behold; but heâ\\x80\\x99s making progress on his way. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno mistaken, callant; a man like me has seen such sights before. It\\nlooks as if it could go on for ever, and nae great difference\\nperceptible from day to day; but the wheelâ\\x80\\x99s aye turning and the thread\\nspinning off, and nobody can say for certain what moment it may break,\\nlike glass, and the spinning come to an end. Ay, itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 mystery.\\nYou may break your heart thinking, but youâ\\x80\\x99ll come to no solution. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\ntried it as much as most men, and should ken;--but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no the matter\\nunder consideration. I would be glad to know something about their\\nfriends.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose they have any friends,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who had by this\\ntime forgotten the suggestion of his English acquaintances. â\\x80\\x9cHe would\\nnever have brought his sister here with him if he had had anyone to\\nleave her with--that is, if he believed, as he says he does, that he was\\ngoing to die,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with a pang of fellow-feeling and\\nnatural pity, â\\x80\\x9cwhich are terrible words to say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no so sure about either of your propositions,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve very little objection to die, for my part. No to speak of hopes a\\nman has as a Christian--though I maybe canna see them as clear as that\\npoor callant thinks he does--it would be an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 satisfaction to ken\\nwhat was the meaning of it all, which is my grand difficulty in this\\nlife. And I cannot say I am satisfied, for that matter, that he brought\\nhis sister here for want of somebody to leave her with; sheâ\\x80\\x99s a kind of\\nproperty that he wouldna like to leave behind. He was not thinking of\\nher when they started, but of himselâ\\x80\\x99; nor can I see that his mindâ\\x80\\x99s\\nawakening to any thought of her even now, though heâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 anxious, no\\ndoubt, about her soul, and yours, and mine. Whisht! itâ\\x80\\x99s temperament,\\ncallant. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no blaming the poor dying lad. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard upon a man if he\\ncannot be permitted to take some bit female creature that belongs to him\\nas far as the graveâ\\x80\\x99s mouth. She maun find her way back from there the\\nbest way she can. Itâ\\x80\\x99s human nature, Colin, for aâ\\x80\\x99 you look like a\\nglaring lion at me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI prefer your ordinary manner of expounding human nature,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t talk like this; if Miss Meredith is left so helpless and\\nsolitary, at all events, Lauderdale, she can rely on you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher shortly; â\\x80\\x9cand grand protectors we would be\\nfor the like of her. Two men no her equals in the eye of the world--Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno heeding your indignant looks, my freend; Iâ\\x80\\x99m a better judge than you\\nof some things--and one of us no of an age to be over and above\\ntrusted. A lad like you can take care of a bit thing like her only in\\none way; and thatâ\\x80\\x99s out of the question under present\\ncircumstances--even if either of you were thinking of such vanities, of\\nwhich I see no sign.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNone whatever,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with momentary heat. â\\x80\\x9cShe is not in my way;\\nand, besides, she is greatly too much occupied to think of any such\\nvanities, as you say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLauderdale cast a half-amused, suspicious look at his companion, whose\\nface was flushed a little. Colin was thinking only of Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s want of\\ncomprehension and sympathy on the previous night; but the touch of\\noffence and mortification was as evident as if she had been unkind to\\nhim in more important particulars.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBeing agreed on that point, itâ\\x80\\x99s easier to manage the rest,â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale\\nresumed, with the ghost of a smile; â\\x80\\x9cand I dinna pretend, for my own\\npart, to be a fit guardian for a young leddy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99 very well for\\nTelle-machus to wander about the world like this, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m no qualified\\nto keep watch and ward over the princess. Poor thing!â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 early to begin her troubles; but I would be\\neasy in my mind, comparatively, if we could find out about their\\nfriends. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s no so very communicative in that particular; and she has\\nher bit womanâ\\x80\\x99s whiles, innocent as she looks. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll give me no\\nsatisfaction, though Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 cunning in my questions. What was it yon\\nsilly woman said about some Meredith of some place? Iâ\\x80\\x99m no without\\nsuspicions in my own mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat sort of suspicions?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cShe said Meredith of Maltby. I\\nwrote it down somewhere. There was a row about him in the papers--donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nyou remember--a few years ago.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh ay, I remember,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cone of them that consume widowsâ\\x80\\x99\\nhouses, and for a pretence make long prayers. The wonder to me is how\\nthis callant, if he should happen to be such a manâ\\x80\\x99s son, did not take a\\nsickening at religion altogether. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the consequence in a common\\nmind. It gives me a higher notion of this poor lad. He has his faults,\\nlike most folk I ken,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 young, which is the\\nchief of all, and itâ\\x80\\x99s one that will never mend in his case in this\\nlife; but, if heâ\\x80\\x99s yon manâ\\x80\\x99s son, no to have abandoned aâ\\x80\\x99 religion, no\\nto have scorned the very name of preaching and prayer, is a clear token\\nto me that the root of the matterâ\\x80\\x99s in him; though he may be a wee\\nunrighteous to his ain flesh and bloodâ\\x80\\x9d--the philosopher went on\\nphilosophically--â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s neither here nor there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf religion does not make us righteous to our own flesh and blood, what\\nis the good of it?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cTo care for souls, as you say, but not\\nto care for leaving his sister so helpless and desolate, would be to me\\nas bad as his fatherâ\\x80\\x99s wickedness. Bah! his father!--what am I saying?\\nHe is no more his father than the Duke is mine. It is only a coincidence\\nof name.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m making no assertions,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cIt may be or it may not\\nbe; Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying: but you should aye bear in mind that thereâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ndifference between practice and theory. To have a good theory--or, if ye\\nlike, a grand ideal--oâ\\x80\\x99 existence, is about as much as a man can attain\\nto in this world. To put it into full practice is reserved, let us aye\\nhope, for the life to come. However, I wouldna say,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nguardian, changing his tone, â\\x80\\x9cbut that kind of practical paradox might\\nrun in the blood. Our friend Arthur, poor man! has no meaning of neglect\\nto his sister. Do no man injustice. Maybe the other had as little\\nintention of cheating them that turned out his victims. An awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\npractical accident like that might be accompanied by a beautiful theory.\\nJust as in the case of his son--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who thought his friend prosy. â\\x80\\x9cWhy will you insist\\non saying â\\x80\\x98his son?â\\x80\\x99 Meredith is not an uncommon name. You might as well\\nsay Owen Meredith was his brother.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing more likely,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, composedly;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbrothers aye take different roads, especially when they come out of\\nsuch a nest; but listen now to what Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got to say----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat Lauderdale had to say was still upon the subject of which Colin by\\nthis time had got tired--the supposed connexion of the brother and\\nsister with the famous, or rather notorious Meredith of Maltby, who was\\none of the great leaders of that fashion of swindling so prevalent a few\\nyears ago, by means of which directors of banks and joint-stock\\ncompanies brought so many people to ruin. Of these practitioners Mr.\\nMeredith of Maltby had been one of the most successful. He had passed\\nthrough one or two disagreeable examinations, it is true, in Insolvent\\nCourts and elsewhere; but he had managed to steer clear of the law, and\\nto retain a comfortable portion of his ill-gotten gains. He was a pious\\nman, who subscribed to all the societies, and had, of course, since\\nthese unpleasant accidents occurred, been held up to public admiration\\nby half the newspapers of Great Britain as an instance of the natural\\neffect produced upon the human mind by an assumption of superior piety;\\nand more than one clever leading article, intended to prove that lavish\\nsubscriptions to benevolent purposes, and attendance at prayer meetings,\\nwere the natural evidences of a mind disposed to prey on its\\nfellow-creatures, had been made pointed and emphatic by his name.\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ccaseâ\\x80\\x9d was subtle enough, and showed that he, at least, had\\nnot forgotten the hint given in the Pantheon. He told Colin that all his\\ncunning inquiries could elicit no information about the father of the\\nforlorn pair. Their mother was dead, and, so far as she was concerned,\\nAlice was sufficiently communicative; and she had an aunt in India whom\\nLauderdale knew by heart. â\\x80\\x9cAâ\\x80\\x99 that is so easy to draw out that the other\\nis all the more remarkable,â\\x80\\x9d said the inquisitor; â\\x80\\x9cand itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ninstructive to see the way she doubles out when I think Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got her in\\na corner--no saying whatâ\\x80\\x99s no true, but fencing like a little Jesuit;\\nthat is, speaking proverbially, and no vouching for my premises, for I\\nken nothing about Jesuits in my ain person. I would like to be at the\\nbottom of a womanâ\\x80\\x99s notions on such subjects. The way that bit thing\\nwill lift up her innocent face, and give me to understand a lee without\\nsaying it--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBe civil,â\\x80\\x9d interrupted Colin; â\\x80\\x9ca lie is strong language, especially as\\nyou have no right whatever to question her so closely.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI said nothing about lies,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cI say she gives me to\\nunderstand a _lee_ without saying a word thatâ\\x80\\x99s no true; which is not\\nonly an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 civil form of expression on my part, but a gift of\\nwomankind that, so far as I ken, is just unparalleled. If it werna\\ninstinct it would be genius. She went so far as once to say, in her bit\\nfine way, that they were not quite happy in aâ\\x80\\x99 their connexions--â\\x80\\x98There\\nare some of our friends that Arthur canâ\\x80\\x99t approve of,â\\x80\\x99 said she, which\\nwas enough to make a man laugh or cry--whichever he might be most\\ndisposed to. A bonnie judge Arthur is, to be believed in like that. But\\nthe end of the whole matter is that Iâ\\x80\\x99m convinced the hot-headed callant\\nhas carried her off from her home without anybodyâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge, and that\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s an angry father you and me will have to answer to when we are left\\nher protectors, as you say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hope I am not afraid to meet anybody when I have justice on my side,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin, loftily. â\\x80\\x9cShe is nothing more to me than any other helpless\\nwoman; but I will do my best to take care of her against any man\\nwhatsoever, if she is trusted to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLauderdale laughed with mingled exasperation and amusement. â\\x80\\x9cBravo,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid; â\\x80\\x9cthe like of thatâ\\x80\\x99s grand talking; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have no hand, for my\\npart, in aiding and abetting domestic treason. Iâ\\x80\\x99m far from easy in my\\nmind on the subject altogether. Itâ\\x80\\x99s ill to vex a dying man, but itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nworse to let a spirit go out of the world with guilt on its head. Iâ\\x80\\x99m in\\nan awfuâ\\x80\\x99 difficulty whether to speak to him or no. If you would but come\\ndown off your high horse and give me a little assistance. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a braw\\nbusiness, take it all together. A young woman, both bonnie and good, but\\nabject to what her brother bids her, even now when heâ\\x80\\x99s living--and us\\ntwo single men, with nae justification for meddling, and an indignant\\nfather, no doubt, to make an account to. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no a position I admire,\\nfor my part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was I that drew you into it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with some resentment.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAfter all, they were my friends to begin with. Donâ\\x80\\x99t let me bring you\\ninto a responsibility which is properly mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, calmly, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s aye the way with you\\ncallants. If a man sees a difficulty in anything concerning you, off you\\nfling, and will have no more to do with him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no one to be dismissed\\nin that fashion--no to say that it would be more becoming to consider\\nthe difficulty, like reasonable creatures, and make up our minds how it\\nis to be met.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, repentant; â\\x80\\x9conly, to be sure, the\\nimprudence, if there was any imprudence, was mine. But it is hard to be\\ntalking in this manner, as if all was over, while Meredith lives, poor\\nfellow. Such invalids live for ever, sometimes. There he is, for a\\nmiracle, riding! When summer comes he may be all right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cI make no doubt of that; but no in your way.\\nHeâ\\x80\\x99ll be better off when summer comes.â\\x80\\x9d Meredith turned a corner close\\nupon them as he spoke. He was riding, it is true, but only on a mule,\\njogging along at a funeral pace, with Alice walking by his side. He\\nsmiled when he met them; but the smile was accompanied by a momentary\\nflush, as of shame or pain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe last step but one,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI have given up walking for ever. I\\ndid not think I should ever have come to this; but my spirit is proud,\\nand needs to be mortified. Campbell, come here. It is long since we have\\nhad any conversation. I thought God was dealing with your soul when I\\nlast talked to you. Tell me, if you were as far gone as I am--if you\\nwere reduced to _this_â\\x80\\x9d--and the sick man laid his thin white hand upon\\nthe neck of the animal he was riding--â\\x80\\x9cwhat consolation would you have\\nto keep you from sinking? It may come sooner than you think.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is not easy to imagine how one would conduct oneself under such\\ncircumstances,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9clet us talk of something else. If it were\\ncoming--and it may be, for anything I can tell--I think I should prefer\\nnot to give it too much importance. Look at that low blaze of sunshine,\\nhow it catches St. Peterâ\\x80\\x99s. These sunsets are like dramas--but nobody\\nplans the grouping beforehand,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with an involuntary\\nallusion which he was sorry for the next moment, but could not recall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is an unkind speech,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cbut I forgive you. If I\\ncould plan the grouping, as you say, I should like to collect all the\\nworld to see me die. Heathens, papists, Mahometans, Christians of every\\ndescription--I would call them to see with what confidence a Christian\\ncould traverse the dark valley, knowing Him who can sustain, and who has\\npreceded him there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, that was Addisonâ\\x80\\x99s idea; but his was an age when people did things\\nfor effect,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin: â\\x80\\x9cand everything I have heard makes me believe\\nthat people generally die very composedly upon the whole. The best and\\nwisest are scarcely superior in that respect to the ignorant and\\nstupid--scarcely even to the wicked. Either people have an infinite\\nconfidence in themselves and their good fortune; or else absolute faith\\nin God is a great deal more general than you think it. I should like to\\nbelieve that last was the case. Pardon me for what I said. You who\\nrealize so strongly what you are going to, should certainly die, when\\nthat time comes, a glorious and joyful death.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt these words a cloud passed over the eager, hectic countenance which\\nMeredith had turned to his friend. â\\x80\\x9cAh, you donâ\\x80\\x99t know,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a\\nsudden depression which Colin had never seen in him before. â\\x80\\x9cSometimes\\nGod sees fit to abandon His servants even in that hour; what, if after\\npreaching to others I should myself be a castaway?â\\x80\\x9d This conversation\\nwas going on while Alice talked to Lauderdale of the housekeeping, and\\nhow the man at the Trattoria had charged a scudo too much in the last\\nweekly bill.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeredith,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, laying his hand on his friendâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and\\nforgetting all the discussion with Lauderdale which had occupied the\\nafternoon, â\\x80\\x9cwhen you say such words as Father and Saviour you put some\\nmeaning in them, do you not? You donâ\\x80\\x99t think it depends upon how you\\nfeel to-day or to-morrow whether God will stand by his children or not?\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in the castaway as you understand it.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, my dear friend, I am afraid you donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in any castaways;\\ndonâ\\x80\\x99t fall into that deadly error and snare of the devil,â\\x80\\x9d said the sick\\nman.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe must not discuss mysteries,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThere are men for whom no\\npunishment is bad enough, and whom no amount of mercy seems to benefit.\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what is to become of them. For my own part I prefer not to\\ninquire. But this I _know_, that my father, much less my mother, would\\nnot altogether abandon their son for any crime; and does not God love us\\nbetter than our fathers and our mothers?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a moisture\\ngathering in his brown eyes and brightening his smile. As for Meredith,\\nhe snatched his hand away, and pushed forward with a feverish impulse. A\\nsound, half sigh, half groan, burst from him, and Colin could see that\\nthis inarticulate complaint had private references of which he knew\\nnothing. Then Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s suggestion returned to his mind with singular\\nforce; but it was not a time to make any inquiries, even if such had\\nbeen possible. Instinctively, without knowing it, Meredith turned from\\nthat subject to the only other which could mutually interest men so\\nunlike each other; and what he said betrayed distinctly enough what had\\nbeen the tenor of his thoughts.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_She_ has no mother,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith, with a little wave of his hand\\ntowards his sister. â\\x80\\x9cPoor Alice! But I have no doubt God has gracious\\npurposes towards her,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, recovering himself. â\\x80\\x9c_This_ is in\\nthe family, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t doubt she will follow me soon.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was thus he disposed of the matter which for the strangers to whose\\ncare he was about to leave her, was a matter of so much anxious thought.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\\n\\n\\nAfter this Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s malady made gradual but rapid progress. When Colin\\nand his friend returned from Rome in the evenings, after their\\nexpeditions there, they thought they could see a difference in his looks\\neven from the morning. He ceased to move about; he ceased to go out;\\nfinally he ceased to get up from his bed. All these changes were\\naccomplished very gradually, with a heart-breaking regularity of\\nsuccession. Alice, who was constantly engaged about him, doing every\\nkind of office for him, was fortunately too much occupied to take full\\ncognizance of that remorseless progress of decay; but the two friends,\\nwho watched it with eyes less urgent than those of love, yet almost more\\npainfully pitiful, could trace all the little advances of the malady.\\nThen there came the time, the last stage of all, when it was necessary\\nto sit up with him all night--an office which Colin and Lauderdale\\nshared between them, to let the poor little sister have a little\\nreluctant rest.\\n\\nThe season had warmed into May, of all seasons the sweetest in Italy. To\\nsee the sun shine, it seemed impossible to think that he would not shine\\nfor ever; and, when the window of the sick room was opened in the early\\nmorning, such a breath of life and happiness came in--such a sweet gust\\nof air, wild from the great breadth of the Campagna, breathing of dews\\nand blossoms--as felt to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s lips like an elixir of life. But that\\nbreathing balm imparted no refreshment to the dying man. He was not\\nsuffering much; he was only weary to the bottom of his soul--languid and\\nyet restless, eager to be moved, yet unable to bear any motion. While\\nAlice withdrew behind them by times to shed the tears that kept always\\ngathering, and say a prayer in her heart for her dying brother--a prayer\\nin which, with a childâ\\x80\\x99s simplicity, she still left room for his\\nrestoration, and called it possible--the two others watched with the\\nprofoundest interest that which was not only the dying of a friend, but\\nthe waning of a life. To see him so individual and characteristic, with\\nall the notable features and even faults of his mind as distinct and\\napparent as if he had been in the strongest health, and yet so near the\\nend, was the strangest spectacle. What was it the end of? He directed\\nthem all from his deathbed, and, indeed, controlled them all, with a\\nwill stronger than ever before, securing his own way in face of all\\ntheir remonstrances, and, indeed, seemed to grow more and more strong,\\nabsolute, and important, as he approached the final stage of\\nweakness--which is a sight always wonderful to see. He kept on writing\\nhis book, propped up upon pillows, as long as he had strength enough to\\nhold the pen; but, when that power too failed him, the unyielding soul\\ncoerced itself into accepting the pen of another, and dictated the last\\nchapter, at which Alice laboured during the day, and which occasionally,\\nto beguile the tedium of the long night-watches, his other attendants\\nwere permitted to carry on.\\n\\nThe nights grew shorter and shorter as the season advanced, and\\nsometimes it was by the lovely light of the dawning morning, instead of\\nthe glimmer of the lamp, that these solemn sentences were written. At\\nother moments, when the patient could not sleep, but was content to\\nrest, wonderful scraps of conversation went on in that chamber of death.\\nMeredith lay gaunt and wasted among his pillows--his great eyes filling\\nthe room, as the spectators sometimes thought; and by his bedside rose,\\nsometimes the gigantic figure of Lauderdale, dimly visible by means of\\nthe faint night-light--sometimes Colinâ\\x80\\x99s young softened face and air of\\ntender compassion. It did not occur to any of the three to ask by what\\nright they came together in relations so near and sacred. The sick manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrothers, had he possessed them, could not have watched him with more\\ncare, or with less doubt about his claim upon all their ministrations:\\nbut they talked with him as perhaps no brother could have\\ntalked--recognising the reality of his position, and even discussing it\\nas a matter in which they too had the profoundest interest. The room was\\nbare enough, and contained little comfort to English eyes--uncarpeted,\\nwith bare tiles underneath the feet, and scantily furnished with an old\\nsofa, a chair or two, and a table. There were two windows, which looked\\nout upon the Campagna which the dying man was to see no more, nor cared\\nto see. But that great living picture, of no benefit to him, was the\\nonly one there; for poor Meredith had himself caused to be taken down\\nfrom the wall a print of the Madonna, and the little cross with its\\nbasin for holy water underneath, which had hung at the head of his bed.\\nHe had even sent away a picture of the Crucifixion--a bad, yet not\\nunimpressive copy. â\\x80\\x9cI want no outward symbols,â\\x80\\x9d said the sick man;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere will be none where I am going,â\\x80\\x9d and this was the beginning of one\\nof those strange talks by night.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 difficult to ken,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cFor my part itâ\\x80\\x99s a\\ngreat wonder to me that there has never been any revelation worthy of\\ncredit out of that darkness. That poor fellow Dives, in the parable, is\\nthe only man I mind of that takes a Christian view of the subject. He\\nwould have sent one to tell. The miracle is, that nae man was ever\\npermitted to come.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t say so,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cOh, my dear friend! if you could but\\nknow the joy it would give me to bring you to Christ before I die--to\\nsee you accept and receive Him. Has not He come to seek and to save?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCallant,â\\x80\\x9d said the watcher, with a long drawn breath, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve longer\\nacquaintance with Him than you can have; and if I dinna believe in Him I\\nwould hang myself, and get to an explanation of all things. If it was\\nnot for Him, wherefore should I, that have nobody dependent on me,\\nendure the mystery? But thatâ\\x80\\x99s no answer to my question. He came to put\\na meaning in the world that has little enough signification without Him,\\nbut no to answer aâ\\x80\\x99 the questions that a human spirit can put to heaven\\nand earth. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve heard of bargains made between them that were to die and\\nthem that had to live--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou put it in a strange way, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man; â\\x80\\x9cmost\\npeople would say, those who had to die. But what can any one want beyond\\nwhat is revealed--Jerusalem the golden? How strange it is to think that\\na worm like me shall so soon be treading those shining streets, while\\nyou--you whom the world thinks so much better off--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhisht,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a husky voice. â\\x80\\x9cDo you no think it would\\nbe an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 satisfaction to us that stay behind if we could have but a\\nglint of the shining streets you speak of? Many a long day weâ\\x80\\x99ll strain\\nour eyes and try hard to see you there, but aâ\\x80\\x99 to little purpose. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nsaying I would not take it on trust for myself, and be content with what\\nGod pleased; but itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to part with them that belong to us, and ken\\nnothing about them--where they are, or how they are--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey are in Heaven! If they were children of God they are with Him,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the sick man, anxiously. â\\x80\\x9cLauderdale, I cannot bear to think that\\nyou do not believe--that perhaps I may not meet you there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMaybe no,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s the awfuâ\\x80\\x99 question. A man\\nmight go ranging about the shining streets (as you say) for ever, and\\nnever find them that belonged to him; or, if thereâ\\x80\\x99s no geographical\\nlimits, there may be others harder to pass. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 little comfort I\\ncan get for my own mind out of shining streets. How am I to picture you\\nto myself, callant, when I take thoughts of you? I have the fancy in my\\nmind to give you messages to friends I have away yonder; but how can I\\ntell if youâ\\x80\\x99ll ever see them? Itâ\\x80\\x99s no a question of believing or not\\nbelieving; I put little faith in Milton, and none in the good books,\\nfrom which two sources we draw a great part of our talk about Heaven.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s no even to ken if theyâ\\x80\\x99re happy or no happy that troubles me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve\\nnae hesitation to speak of in leaving _that_ in Godâ\\x80\\x99s hand. Itâ\\x80\\x99s but to\\nhave an inkling ever so slight where ye are, and how you are,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, unconsciously changing his pronouns, â\\x80\\x9cand that ye keep\\nthought of us that spend so many thoughts on you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAfter this there was a little pause, which fell into the perfect\\nstillness of the night outside, and held the little dim-lighted chamber\\nin the midst of all the darkness, like the picture of a shadowy\\nâ\\x80\\x9cinterior,â\\x80\\x9d with two motionless figures, the living and the dying,\\npainted upon the great gloom of night. Meredith, who, notwithstanding\\nthe superior intensity of his own thoughts, had been moved by\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s--and who, used as he was to think himself dying, yet\\nperhaps heard himself thus unconsciously reckoned among the dead with a\\nmomentary thrill--was the first to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIn all this I find you too vague,â\\x80\\x9d said the patient. â\\x80\\x9cYou speak about\\nHeaven as if you were uncertain only of its aspect; you have no anxiety\\nabout the way to get there. My friend, you are very good to me--you are\\nexcellent, so far as this world goes; I know you are. But, oh,\\nLauderdale, think! Our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Before you\\nspeculate about Heaven, ask yourself are you sure to get there?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, vaguely, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s maybe a wee like the question of\\nthe Sadducees--Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying; and itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99, the dead blank of wisdom\\nand knowledge thatâ\\x80\\x99s put forth for a response--no any information to\\nyou; nothing but a quenching of your flippant questions and impudent\\npretensions. No marrying nor giving in marriage there, and the curious\\nfools baffled, but nae light thrown upon the darkness! Iâ\\x80\\x99ll have to wait\\nlike other folk for my answer; but, if itâ\\x80\\x99s according to your new nature\\nand faculties--which surely it must be--youâ\\x80\\x99ll not forget to give us a\\nthought at times? If you feel a wee lonely at the first--Iâ\\x80\\x99m no profane,\\ncallant; youâ\\x80\\x99re but a man when aâ\\x80\\x99s done, or rather a laddie, and youâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nsurely miss your friends--dinna forget how long and how often weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nthink of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShall you?â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man. â\\x80\\x9cI have given you nothing but trouble\\never since I knew you, and it is more than I deserve. But there is One\\nwho is worthy of all your thoughts. When you think of me, O love Him, my\\ndear friend, and so there will be a bond between us still.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale once more. It was a word he used when his voice\\ncould not be trusted, and his heart was full. â\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d he repeated, after a\\nlong pause, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no neglect that grand bond. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a bargain between you\\nand me no to be broken. If ye were free for such an act, it would be\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 friendly to bring me word how things areâ\\x80\\x9d--he continued, in a low\\ntone, â\\x80\\x9cthough itâ\\x80\\x99s folly to ask, for if it had been possible it would\\nhave been done before now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is God who must teach and not me,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man. â\\x80\\x9cHe has other\\ninstruments--and you must seek Him for yourself, and let Him reveal His\\nwill to you. If you are faithful to Godâ\\x80\\x99s service, He will relieve you\\nof your doubts,â\\x80\\x9d said Arthur, who did not understand his friendâ\\x80\\x99s mind,\\nbut even at that solemn moment looked at him with a perplexed mixture of\\ndisapproval and compassion. And thus the silence fell again like a\\ncurtain over the room, and once more it became a picture faintly painted\\non the darkness, faintly relieved and lighted up by touches of growing\\nlight, till at length the morning came in full and fair, finding out as\\nwith a sudden surprise the ghostly face on the pillow, with its great\\neyes closed in disturbed sleep, and by the bedside another face scarcely\\nless motionless, the face of the man who was no unbeliever, but whose\\nheart longed to know and see what others were content, in vague\\ngeneralities to tell of, and say they believed.\\n\\nThis was one of the conversations held in the dead of night in\\nMeredithâ\\x80\\x99s room. Next evening it was Colin, reluctantly permitted by his\\nfaithful guardian to share this labour, who took the watcherâ\\x80\\x99s place;\\nand then the two young men, who were so near of an age, but whose\\nprospects were so strangely different, talked to each other after a\\ndifferent fashion. Both at the beginning of their career, and with\\nincalculable futures before them, it was natural they should discuss the\\nobjects and purposes of life, upon which Meredith, who thought himself\\nmatured by the approach of death, had, as he imagined, so much advantage\\nover his friend, who was not going to die.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI remember once thinking as you do,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man. â\\x80\\x9cThe world\\nlooked so beautiful! No man ever loved its vanities and its pomp more\\nthan I. I shudder sometimes to think what would have become of me if God\\nhad left me to myself--but He was more merciful. I see things in their\\ntrue light now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou will have a great advantage over us,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, trying to smile;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cfor you will always know the nature of our occupations, while yours\\nwill be a mystery to us. But we can be friends all the same. As for me,\\nI shall not have many pomps and vanities to distract me; a poor manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nson, and a Scotch minister does not fall in the way of such\\ntemptations.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere are temptations to worldliness in every sphere,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou once spoke eagerly about going to Oxford, and taking honours. My\\ndear friend, trust a dying man. There are no honours worth thinking of\\nbut the crown and the palm, which Christ bestows on them that love Him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut we are not all chosen for these. If I have to\\nlive, I must qualify myself the best I can for my work. I should like to\\nbe of a little use to Scotland, if that was possible. When I hear the\\npoor people here singing their vespers----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, Campbell! one word--let me speak,â\\x80\\x9d said his friend. â\\x80\\x9cAlice showed\\nme the poem you gave her. You donâ\\x80\\x99t mean it, I know; but let me beg you\\nnot to utter such sentiments. You seem to consent to the doctrine of\\npurgatory, one of the worst delusions of the Church of Rome. There are\\nno spirits in prison, my dear, dear friend. When I leave you, I shall be\\nwith my Saviour. Donâ\\x80\\x99t give your countenance to such inventions of the\\ndevil.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat was not what I intended to say,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who had no heart for\\nargument. â\\x80\\x9cI meant that to see the habit of devotion of all these\\npeople, whom we call so ignorant, and to remember how little we have of\\nthat among our own people, whom we think enlightened, goes to my heart.\\nI should like to do a priestâ\\x80\\x99s duty----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAgain!â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cDear Campbell, you will be a minister; there is\\nbut one great High Priest.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cmost true, and the greatest of all consolations. But\\nyet I believe in priests inferior--priests who need be nothing more than\\nmen. I am not so much for teaching as you are, you know; I have so\\nlittle to teach any man. With you who are going to the Fount of all\\nknowledge it will be different. I can conceive, I can imagine how\\nmagnificent may be _your_ work,â\\x80\\x9d the young man said, with a faltering\\nvoice, as he laid his warm young hand upon the fingers which were almost\\ndead.\\n\\nMeredith closed his hand upon that of his friend, and looked at him with\\nhis eyes so clear and awful, enlarged and lighted up with the prescience\\nof what was to come. â\\x80\\x9cIf you do your work faithfully it will be the same\\nwork,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cOur Master alone knows the particulars. If I might have\\nperhaps to supplement and complete what you do on earth!--Ah, but I must\\nnot be tempted into vain speculations! Enough that I shall know His will\\nand see Him as He is. I desire no more.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAmen,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cand, when you are in your new career, think of me\\nsometimes, worried and vexed as I know I shall be. We shall not be able\\nto communicate then, but I know now beforehand what I shall have to go\\nthrough. You donâ\\x80\\x99t know Scotland, Meredith. A man who tries for any new\\nreformation in the Church will have to fight for trifles of detail which\\nare not worth fighting for, and perhaps get both himself and his work\\ndegraded in consequence. You can know no such cares. Think of me\\nsometimes when you are doing your work â\\x80\\x98with thunders of acclaim.â\\x80\\x99 I\\nwonder--but you would think it a profanity if I said what I was going to\\nsay.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat was it?â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith, who, indeed, would not have been sorry had\\nhis friend uttered a profanity which might give him occasion to speak,\\nfor perhaps the last time, â\\x80\\x9cfaithfullyâ\\x80\\x9d to his soul.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wonder,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, whose voice was low, â\\x80\\x9cwhether our Master, who\\nsees us both, though we cannot see each other, might tell you sometimes\\nwhat your friend was doing. He, too, is a man. I mean no irreverence,\\nMeredith. There were men for whom, above His tenderness for all, He had\\na special love. I should like to think it. I can know nothing of you;\\nbut then I am less likely to forget you, staying behind in this familiar\\nworld.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd the two youths again clasped hands, tears filling the eyes of the\\nliving one, but no moisture in the clear orbs of him who was about to\\ndie.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLet us be content to leave it all in His hands,â\\x80\\x9d said Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cGod\\nbless you, Colin, for your love; but think nothing of me; think of Him\\nwho is our first and greatest Friend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then again came silence and sleep, and the night throbbed silently\\nround the lighted chamber and the human creatures full of thought; and\\nagain there took place the perennial transformation, the gradual rising\\nof the morning light, the noiseless entrance of the day, finding out,\\nwith surprised and awful looks, the face of the dying. This is how the\\nlast nights were spent. Down below in the convent there was a good\\nfriar, who watched the light in the window, and pondered much in his\\nmind whether he should not go thither with his crucifix, and save the\\npoor young heretic in spite of himself; but the Frate was well aware\\nthat the English resented such interruptions, and did better for Arthur;\\nfor he carried the thought of him through all his devotions, and\\nmuttered under his breath the absolution, with his eyes fixed upon the\\nlighted window, and prayed, if he had any credit in heaven, through the\\ncompassionate saints, the Blessed Virgin, and by the aid of Him whose\\nimage he held up towards the unseen sufferer, that the sins which Godâ\\x80\\x99s\\nservant had thus remitted on earth might be, even without the knowledge\\nof the penitent, remitted in heaven. Thus Colinâ\\x80\\x99s belief in priests was\\njustified without his knowing it; and perhaps God judged the\\nintercession of Father Francisco more tenderly than poor Arthur would\\nhave done. And with these private proceedings, which the world was\\nunaware of, night after night passed on until the night came which was\\nto have no day.\\n\\nThey had all assembled in the room, in which it seemed before morning so\\ngreat an event was to happen--all worn and tired out with watching; the\\nevidences of which appeared upon Colin and Alice, though Lauderdale,\\nmore used to exertion, wore his usual aspect. As usual, Meredith lay\\nvery solemnly in a kind of pathetic youthful state in his bed;\\nstruggling for every breath, yet never forgetting that he lay there\\nbefore heaven and earth, a monument as he said of Godâ\\x80\\x99s grace, and an\\nexample of how a Christian could die. He called Alice, and the others\\nwould have withdrawn; but this he would not permit. â\\x80\\x9cWe have no secrets\\nto discuss,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI am not able to say much now. Let my last words\\nbe for Christ. Alice, you are the last. We have all died of it. It is\\nnot very hard; but you cannot die in peace, as I do, unless you give\\nyourself to Christ. These are my last words to my sister. You may not\\nlive long--you have not a moment to spare. Give yourself to Christ, my\\nlittle Alice, and then your death-bed will be as peaceful as mine.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said the docile sister, through her sobs, â\\x80\\x9cI will never, never\\nforget what you have said to me. Oh, Arthur, you are going to them all!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am going to God,â\\x80\\x9d said the dying man; â\\x80\\x9cI am going to my Lord and\\nSaviour--that is all I desire to think of now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd there was a momentary breathless pause. She had his hand in both of\\nhers, and was crying with an utter despair and abandonment to which she\\nhad never given herself up before. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Arthur--papa!â\\x80\\x9d the poor girl\\nsaid, under her breath. If they had been less interested, or if the\\nstillness had been a degree less intense, the voice was so low that the\\ntwo other watchers could not have heard her. But the answer was spoken\\naloud.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTell him I forgive him, Alice. I can say so now. Tell him to repent\\nwhile there is time. If you wish it, you can tell Colin and\\nLauderdale--they have been brothers to us. Come here, all of you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nMeredith. â\\x80\\x9cHear my last words. Nothing is of any importance but the love\\nof Christ. I have tried everything in the world--its pleasures and its\\nambitions--and--But everything except Christ is vanity. Come to Him\\nwhile it is called to-day. And now come and kiss me, Alice, for I am\\ngoing to die.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, no, Arthur. Oh, Arthur, do not leave me yet!â\\x80\\x9d cried the poor girl.\\nLauderdale drew her gently away, and signed to Colin to take the place\\nby the bed. He drew her hand through his arm and led her softly into the\\ngreat empty _salone_, where there was no light except that of the moon,\\nwhich came in in broad white bars at the side windows. â\\x80\\x9cWhisht! itâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\nbe yet,â\\x80\\x9d said the kind guardian who had taken possession of Alice. No\\nmother or lover could have been tenderer with the little forlorn\\ncreature in this hour which was the most terrible of all. He made her\\nwalk softly about with him, beguiling her awful suspense a little with\\nthat movement. â\\x80\\x9cA little more strength, for his sake,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale;\\nâ\\x80\\x9canother trial--and then nobody shall stop your tears. Itâ\\x80\\x99s for his\\nsake; the last thing you can do for him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then the poor little sister gave utterance to a bitter cry, â\\x80\\x9cIf he\\nwould say something kind for papa, I could bear it,â\\x80\\x9d she said,\\nsmothering her painful sobs; and Lauderdale drew her closer on his arm,\\nsupporting and soothing her, and led her about, slowly and noiselessly,\\nin the great empty room, lighted with those broad bars of moonlight,\\nwaiting till she had regained a little composure to return to the\\nchamber of death.\\n\\nMeredith lay silent for some time, with his great eyes gazing into the\\nvacancy before him, and the last thrill of fever in his frame. He\\nthought he was thus coming with all his faculties alert and vivid to a\\ndirect conscious encounter with the unknown might of death. â\\x80\\x9cGet the\\nbook, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a voice which yet possessed a certain\\nnervous strength; â\\x80\\x9cit is now time to write the conclusionâ\\x80\\x9d--and\\nhe dictated with a steady voice the date of his last\\npostscript:--â\\x80\\x9cFrascati, midnight, May 16th.--The last hour of my\\nlife----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV.\\n\\n\\nMeredith died the next day, after a struggle longer and harder than\\ncould have been anticipated, and very differently from the manner in\\nwhich, when he dictated his last message to the world, he expected to\\ndie. Few human creatures are strong enough, except in books, to march\\nthus solemnly and statelily to the edge of the grave. The last event\\nitself was twenty-four hours later than the anxious watchers expected\\nit to be, and wore them all out more utterly than any previous part of\\ntheir patientâ\\x80\\x99s lingering illness. He dictated his postscript, lying in\\ngreat exhaustion, but solemn calm, not without a certain pomp of\\nconscious grandeur, victorious over death and the grave. â\\x80\\x9cThat great\\nangel whom men call the last enemy is standing by my bedside,â\\x80\\x9d the dying\\nman said, giving forth his last utterance slowly word by word. â\\x80\\x9cIn an\\nhour I shall be clay and ashes. I send you, friends, this last message.\\nDeath is not terrible to those who love Christ. I feel a strength in me\\nthat is not my own. I had fears and doubts, but I have them no longer.\\nThe gates of heaven are opening. I close my eyes, for I can no longer\\nsee the lights of this world; when I open them again it will be to\\nbehold the face of my Lord. Amen. This I say to all the world with my\\nlast breath. For those who love Christ it is not hard to die.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin, who wrote the words, trembled over them with a weakness like a\\nwomanâ\\x80\\x99s; but Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s broken and interrupted voice was shaken only by\\nthe last pangs of mortality, not by any faltering of the spirit. â\\x80\\x9cI tell\\nyou, Colin, it is not hard,â\\x80\\x9d he said, and smiled upon his friend, and\\ncomposed himself to meet the last encounter; but such was not the end.\\nThe long night lingered on, and the dying man dozed a little, and woke\\nagain less dignified and composed. Then came the weary morning, with its\\ndreadful daylight which made the heart sick, and then a long day of\\ndying, terrible to behold, perhaps not so hard to bear. The two who were\\nhis brothers at this dreadful moment exercised all their power to keep\\nAlice out of the room where this struggle was going on, but the gentle\\nlittle girl was a faithful woman, and kept her place. He had had his\\nmoment of conscious victory, but now in its turn the human soul was\\nvanquished. He became unconscious of their consoling presence, conscious\\nof nothing but the awful restlessness, the intolerable languor and yet\\nmore intolerable nervous strength which kept him alive in spite of\\nhimself; and then the veiled and abstracted spirit awoke to matters of\\nwhich, when in full possession of his faculties, Arthur had made no\\nmention. He began to murmur strange words as he lay tossing in that last\\nstruggle. â\\x80\\x9cTell my father,â\\x80\\x9d he said once or twice, but never finished\\nthe message. That death so clear and conscious, for which he had hoped,\\nwas not granted to him; and, when at last the deliverance came, even\\nAlice, on her knees by the bedside, felt in her desolation a momentâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrelief. It was almost dawn of the second morning when they raised her\\nup and led her tenderly away to Sora Antonia, the kind Italian woman,\\nwho waited outside. Colin was scarcely less overwhelmed than she. The\\nyoung man sank down by the table where, on the previous night, he had\\nbeen Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s secretary, and almost fainting dropped his head upon the\\nbook which still lay open there. Twenty-four hours only of additional\\nhard labour added on to the ending life; but it looked as many years to\\nthe young inexperienced spirit which had thus, for the first time,\\nfollowed another, so far as a spectator can, through the valley of the\\nshadow of death.\\n\\nLauderdale, who knew better, and upon whose greater strength this\\ndreadful strain of watching had made a less visible impression, had to\\ndo for Colin what the kind peasant woman was doing for the desolate\\nsister--to take him away from the chamber of death, and make him lie\\ndown, and put aside altogether his own sensations on behalf of the\\nyounger and more susceptible sufferer. All that had to be done fell on\\nLauderdale; he made the necessary arrangements with a self-command which\\nnothing disturbed, and, when he could satisfy himself that both the\\nyoung worn-out creatures, who were his children for the moment, had got\\nthe momentary solace of sleep, as was natural, he threw himself into\\npoor Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s arm-chair and pondered with a troubled countenance on all\\nthat might follow. There he too slept and dozed, as Sora Antonia went\\nsoftly to and fro, moved with pity. She had said her rosary for Arthur\\nmany a morning, and had done all she could to interest in his behalf\\nthat good St. Antonio of Padua, who was so charitable, and perhaps might\\nnot be so particular about a matter of doctrine as St. Paul or St.\\nPeter; for Sora Antonia was kind to the bottom of her heart, and could\\nnot bear to think of more than a thousand years or so of Purgatory for\\nthe poor young heretic. â\\x80\\x9cThe Signorino was English and knew no better,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said to her patron saint--and comforted herself with the thought\\nthat the blessed Antonio would not fail to attend to her recommendation,\\nand that she had done the best she could for her lodger. From the room\\nwhere Alice slept the deep sleep of exhaustion the good woman made many\\nvoyages into the silent _salone_, where the shutters were closed upon\\nthe bare windows, though the triumphant sun streamed in at every\\ncrevice. She looked at Lauderdale, who dozed in the great chair, with\\ncurious looks of speculation and inquiry. He looked old and grey, thus\\nsleeping in the daylight, and the traces of exhaustion in such a face as\\nhis were less touching than the lines in Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s gentle countenance or\\nthe fading of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s brightness. He was the only member of the party\\nwho looked responsible to the eyes of Sora Antonia; and already she had\\na little romance in hand, and wondered much whether this uncle, or elder\\nbrother, or guardian, would be favourable to her young people. Thus,\\nwhile the three watchers found a momentâ\\x80\\x99s sad rest after their long\\nvigil, new hopes and thoughts of life already began to play about them\\nunawares. The world will not stand still even to see the act of death\\naccomplished; and the act of death itself, if Arthur was right in his\\nhopes, had not that already opened its brighter side upon the solitary\\nsoul which had gone forth alone?\\n\\nThe day after everything was finally over was Sunday--the gayest and\\nbrightest of summer festal days. Colin and Lauderdale, who had on the\\nday before carried their friend to his grave, met each other sadly at\\nthe table, where it was so strange to take up again the common thread of\\nlife as though Arthur Meredith had never had any share in it. It was\\nSunday under its brightest aspect; the village was very gay outside, and\\nneither of them felt capable of introducing their sombre shadows into\\nthe flowery and sunny festa, the gaiety of which jarred upon their\\nsadness; and they had no heart to go about their usual occupations\\nwithin. When they had swallowed their coffee together, they withdrew\\nfrom each other into different corners, and tried to read, which was the\\nonly employment possible. Lauderdale, for his part, in his listlessness\\nand fatigue, went to rummage among some books which a former occupant\\nhad left, and brought from among them--the strangest choice for him to\\nmake--a French novel, a kind of production utterly unknown to him. The\\nchances are, he had forgotten it was Sunday; for his Scotch prejudices,\\nthough he held them lightly in theory, still held him fast in practice.\\nWhen, however, he had pored over it vaguely for half an hour (for\\nreading French was a laborious amusement to the imperfectly instructed\\nscholar), Colin was roused out of studies which he, too, pursued with a\\nvery divided attention, by a sudden noise, and saw the little yellow\\nvolume spin through the air out of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s vigorous fingers, and\\ndrop ignominiously in a corner. â\\x80\\x9cMe to be reading stuff like that!â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, with grim accents of self disgust; â\\x80\\x9cand him maybe near to\\nsee what a fool is doing!â\\x80\\x9d As he said this, he got up from his chair,\\nand began to pace about the quiet, lonely room, violently endeavouring\\nto recover the composure which he had not been able to preserve. Though\\nhe was older and stronger than the others, watching and grief had told\\nupon his strength also; and, in the glory of the summer morning which\\nblazed all round and about, the soul of this wayfaring man grew sick\\nwithin him. Something like a sob sounded into the silence. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nasking if heâ\\x80\\x99s happy,â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale burst forth; â\\x80\\x9cI cannot feel as if I\\nwould esteem him the same if he felt nothing but joy to get away. Youâ\\x80\\x99re\\naâ\\x80\\x99 infidels and unbelievers alike, with your happiness and your heaven.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m no saying that itâ\\x80\\x99s less than the supreme joy to see the face he\\nhoped to see--but joyâ\\x80\\x99s no inconsistent with pain. Will you tell me the\\ncallant, having a heart as you know he had, can think of us mourning for\\nhim and no care? Dinna speak of such inhuman imaginations to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, softly. â\\x80\\x9cBut worst of all would be to think he was\\nhere,â\\x80\\x9d the young man continued, after a pause, â\\x80\\x9cunable to communicate\\nwith us anyhow, by whatsoever effort. Donâ\\x80\\x99t think so, Lauderdale; that\\nis the most inhuman imagination of all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no so clear of that,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, subduing his hasty\\nsteps; â\\x80\\x9cnae doubt there would be a pang in it, especially when there was\\ninformation like that to bestow; but itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to tell, in our leemited\\ncondition, aâ\\x80\\x99 the capabilities of a soul. It might be a friend close by,\\nand no yourselâ\\x80\\x99, that put your best thought in your head, though you saw\\nhim not. I wouldna say that I would object to that. Itâ\\x80\\x99s all a question\\nof temperament, and, maybe, age,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, calming himself entirely\\ndown, and taking a seat beside Colin in the window. â\\x80\\x9cThe like of you\\nexpects response, and has no conception of life without it; but the like\\nof me can be content without response,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian; and then\\nhe regarded his companion with eyes in which the love was veiled by a\\ngrave mist of meditation. â\\x80\\x9cI would not object to take the charge of you\\nin such a manner,â\\x80\\x9d he said, slowly. â\\x80\\x9cBut itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy to dream\\ndreams,--if anything on this earth could but make a man _know_;â\\x80\\x9d--and\\nthen there followed another pause. â\\x80\\x9cHe was awfuâ\\x80\\x99 pleased to teach,â\\x80\\x9d\\nLauderdale resumed, with an unsteady smile. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s strange to think what\\nshould hinder him speaking now, when he has such news to tell. I never\\ncould make it out, for my part. Whiles my mind inclines to the thought\\nthat it must be a peaceable sleep that wraps them aâ\\x80\\x99 till the great day,\\nwhich would account for the awfuâ\\x80\\x99 silence; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s some things that\\ngo against that. This is what makes me most indignant at thae idiots\\nwith their spirit-rapping and gibberish. Does ony mortal with a heart\\nwithin his bosom dare to think that, if Love doesna open their sealed\\nlips, any power in the world can?â\\x80\\x9d cried the philosopher, whose emotion\\nagain got beyond his control. He got up again, and resumed his\\nmelancholy march up and down the room. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 marvel, beyond my\\nreach,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cwhen a word of communication would make aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\ndifference, why itâ\\x80\\x99s no permitted--if it were but to keep a heart from\\nbreaking here and there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps it is our own fault,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cperhaps flesh and blood\\nshrinks more than we are aware of from such a possibility; and\\nperhaps--â\\x80\\x9d here the young man paused a little, â\\x80\\x9cindeed, it is not\\nperhaps. Does not God Himself choose to be our comforter?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyouthful pre-destined priest; upon which the older and sadder man once\\nmore composed himself with a groan.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cI can say nothing against that argument. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\ndenying itâ\\x80\\x99s the last and the greatest. I speak the voice of a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\nyearning--but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no intention of contravening the truth. Heâ\\x80\\x99s gone\\nlike many a one before him. You and me must bide our time. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say no\\nmore of Arthur. The best thing you can do is to read a chapter. If we\\ncanna hear of him direct, which is no to be hoped for, we can take as\\ngood a grip as possible of the Friend that stands between us. Itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlittle use trying to forget--or trying no to think and inquire and\\nquestion. There is but one thing in the world, so far as I can see, that\\na man can feel a kind of sure of. Callant, read a chapter,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale, with a long sigh. He threw himself back, as he spoke, in the\\nnearest chair, and Colin took his Bible dutifully to obey. The contrast\\nbetween this request, expressed as any Scotch peasant would have\\nexpressed it, and the speculations which preceded it, did not startle\\nColin, and he had opened the book by instinct in the latter part of St.\\nJohnâ\\x80\\x99s Gospel, when he was disturbed by the entrance of Alice, who came\\nin softly from her room without any warning. Her long attendance on her\\nbrother had withdrawn the colour from her cheeks and the fulness from\\nher figure so gradually, that it was only now in her mourning dress that\\nher companions saw how pale and thin she had grown. Alice was not\\nspeculative, nor fanciful, nor addicted to undue exercise of the\\nfaculties of her own mind in any way. She was a dutiful woman, young and\\nsimple, and accepted Godâ\\x80\\x99s will without inquiry or remonstrance. Though\\nshe had struggled long against the thought of Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s death, now that\\nhe _was_ dead she recognized and submitted to the event which it was no\\nlonger possible to avert or change, with a tender and sweet resignation\\nof which some women are capable. A more forlorn and desolate creature\\nthan Alice Meredith did not exist on the earth, to all ordinary\\nappearance, at this moment; but, as she was not at all thinking of\\nherself, that aspect of the case did not occur to her.\\n\\nShe came out of her room very softly, with a faint smile on her face,\\nholding some Prayer-books in her hands. Up to this sad day it had been\\ntheir custom to read prayers together on the Sundays, being too far off\\nRome to make it practicable even for the stronger members of the party\\nto go to church. Alice came up to Colin with her books in her hands--she\\nsaid to him in a wistful whisper, â\\x80\\x9cYou will take his place,â\\x80\\x9d and pointed\\nout to him silently the marks she had placed at the lessons and psalms.\\nThen she knelt down between the two awed and astonished men, to say the\\nfamiliar prayers which only a week ago Arthur himself had read with his\\ndying voice. Though at times articulation was almost impossible to\\nColin, and Lauderdale breathed out of his deep chest an Amen which\\nsounded like a groan, Alice did not falter in her profound and still\\ndevotions. She went over the well-known prayers word by word, with eye\\nand voice steadfast and rapt in the duty which was at the same time a\\nconsolation. There are women of such sweet loyalty and submission of\\nspirit, but neither Lauderdale nor Colin had met with them before.\\nPerhaps a certain passiveness of intellect had to do with it, as well as\\nAliceâ\\x80\\x99s steady English training and custom of self-suppression; but it\\nmade a wonderful impression upon the two who were now the sole\\ncompanions and guardians of the friendless young woman, and gave her\\nindeed for the moment an absolute empire over them, of which Alice was\\naltogether unconscious, and of which, even had she known it, she could\\nhave made no further use. When the Morning Prayer was almost concluded\\nit was she who indicated to Colin another mark in the Prayer-book, at\\nthe prayer for Christâ\\x80\\x99s Church militant on earth; and they could even\\nhear the whisper of her voice broken by an irrestrainable sob at the\\nthanksgiving for all â\\x80\\x9cThy servants departed this life in Thy faith and\\nfear,â\\x80\\x9d which Colin read with agitation and faltering. When they rose\\nfrom their knees, she turned from one to the other with her countenance\\nfor the first time disturbed. â\\x80\\x9cYou were very very good to him,â\\x80\\x9d she\\nsaid, softly. â\\x80\\x9cGod will bless you for it,â\\x80\\x9d and so sank into sobbing and\\ntears, which were not to be subdued any longer, yet were not passionate\\nnor out of accordance with her docile looks. After that, Alice recovered\\nher calm, and began to occupy herself with them as if she had been their\\nmother. â\\x80\\x9cHave you been out?â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cYou must not stay in and make\\nyourself ill.â\\x80\\x9d This was addressed specially to Colin. â\\x80\\x9cPlease go out\\nand take a walk; it will do you a great deal of good. If it had not have\\nbeen a great festa it would not have been so bad; but, if you go up to\\nthe Villa Conti, you will find nobody there. Go up behind the terrace,\\ninto the alleys where it is shady. There is one on the way to the\\nAldobrandini; you know it, Mr. Campbell. Oh go, please; it is such a\\nbeautiful day, it will do you good.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who felt in his heart an inclination to kneel to\\nher as if she had been a queen.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI shall stay at home to-day,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice. â\\x80\\x9cI could not go out to-day;\\nbut I shall do very well. Sora Antonia will come in from mass presently.\\nOh, go out, please, and take a walk. Mr. Lauderdale, he will go if you\\ntell him to go--you are both looking so pale.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCome, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cshe shall have her pleasure done this\\nday, at least, whatsoever she commands. If there was anything within my\\npower or his--â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with a strange discord that\\nsounded like tears in his voice; but Alice stopped him short.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d she said, softly, â\\x80\\x9cit is very good of you to do it because I\\nask you. Mr. Campbell, you did not read the right lesson,â\\x80\\x9d she added,\\nturning her worn face to Colin with a slight reproach.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI read what I thought was better for us all, mourning as we are,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin, startled; upon which the sad little representative of law and\\norder did her best to smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have always heard it said how wonderful it was how the lesson for the\\nday always suited everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s case,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice. â\\x80\\x9cArthur never would\\nmake any change for circumstances. He--he said it was as if God could\\never be wanting,â\\x80\\x9d the faithful sister said, through her sobs; and then,\\nagain, put force upon herself:--â\\x80\\x9cI shall be here when you come back,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said, with her faint smile; and so, like a little princess, sent\\nthem away. The two men went their way up the slope and through the\\nlittle town, in their black coats, casting two tall, sombre shadows into\\nthe sunshine and gaiety of the bright piazza. There had been a\\nprocession that morning, and the rough pavement was strewed with sprigs\\nof myrtle and box, and the air still retained a flavour of the candles,\\nnot quite obliterated by the whiff of incense which came from the open\\ndoors of the Cathedral, where even the heavy leathern curtain, generally\\nsuspended across the entrance, had been removed by reason of the crowd.\\nPeople were kneeling even on the steps; peasants in their laced\\nbuskins, and Frascati women, made into countesses or duchesses, at the\\nleast, by the long white veils which streamed to their feet. The windows\\nwere all hung with brilliant draperies in honour of the morningâ\\x80\\x99s\\nprocession and the afternoonâ\\x80\\x99s Tombola. It was one of the very chief of\\nItalian holydays, a festal Sunday in May, the month of Mary. No wonder\\nthe two sad Protestant Scotchmen, with mourning in their dress and in\\ntheir hearts, felt themselves grow sick and faint as they went dutifully\\nto the gardens of the Villa Conti, as they had been commanded. They did\\nnot so much as exchange a word with each other till they had passed\\nthrough all that sunshine and reached the identical alley, a close\\narcade, overarched and shut in by the dense foliage of ilex-trees, to\\nwhich their little sovereign had directed them. There was not a soul\\nthere as she had prophesied. A tunnel scooped out of the damp, dewy soil\\ncould scarcely have been more absolutely shut in from the sunshine,\\nscarcely could have been stiller or cooler, or more withdrawn from the\\nblazing noonday, with its noises and rejoicings, than this narrow sombre\\navenue. They strayed down its entire length, from one blue arch of\\ndaylight to the other, before they spoke; and then it was Lauderdale who\\nbroke the silence, as if his thoughts, generally so busy and so vagrant,\\nhad never got beyond Alice Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s last words.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnother time, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll no make ony changes\\nin the lesson for the day. Whiles itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to put up with the\\nconditions oâ\\x80\\x99 a leemited intellect; but whiles theyâ\\x80\\x99re half divine. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno pretending to be reasonable. She kens no more about reason than--the\\nangels, maybe--I admit itâ\\x80\\x99s a new development to me; but a woman like\\nyon, callant, would keep a man awfuâ\\x80\\x99 steady in the course of his life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and then with a strange premonition, for which he\\nhimself could not account, he added--â\\x80\\x9cShe would keep a man steady, as\\nyou say; but he would find little response in her--not that I regard her\\nless respectfully, less reverentially than you do, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d he went\\non, hurriedly, â\\x80\\x9cbut--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt wasna your opinion I was asking for,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher somewhat\\nmorosely. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s like none of the women you and me ken. Iâ\\x80\\x99m doubtful in\\nmy own mind whether that dutiful and obedient spirit has ever been our\\nideal in our country. Intellectâ\\x80\\x99s a grand gift, callant, baith to man\\nand woman; but youâ\\x80\\x99ll no fly in my face and assert that itâ\\x80\\x99s more than\\nsecond best.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not up to argument to-day,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and they walked back\\nagain the whole length of the avenue in silence. Perhaps a certain\\nirritability, torn of their mutual grief, was at the bottom of this\\nmomentary difference; but somehow, in the stillness, in the subdued\\nleafy shade, which at first sight had been so congenial to his feelings,\\nan indescribable shadow stole over Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind--a kind of indistinct\\nfear and reluctance, which took no definite shape, but only crept over\\nhim like a mist over the face of the sun. His heart was profoundly\\ntouched at once by the grief and by the self command of Alice, and by\\nher utter helplessness and dependence upon himself and his friend. Never\\nbefore had he been so attracted towards her, nor felt so much that\\ndangerous softening sentiment of pity and admiration, which leads to\\nlove. And yet--; the two walked back silently under the dark ilex-trees,\\nand across the piazza, which was now thronged with a gay and\\nmany-coloured crowd. The brighter the scene grew around them, the more\\nthey shut themselves up in their own silence and sorrow, as was natural;\\nand Colin at length began to recognise a new element, which filled him\\nwith vague uneasiness--an element not in the least new to the perplexed\\ncogitations of his guardian and anxious friend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\\n\\n\\nWhen they entered the _salone_ on their return, the first object which\\nmet their eyes was the stately figure of Sora Antonia in full holiday\\ncostume, lately returned from mass. She had still her fan and her rosary\\ndepending from her wrist--adjuncts almost equally necessary to devotion,\\nas that is understood at Frascati--and was still arrayed in the full\\nsplendours of the veil, which, fastened over her hair, fell almost to\\nher feet behind, and gave grace and dignity to her tall and stately\\nperson. Sora Antonia was a dependent of the family Savvelli; scarcely a\\nservant, though she had once belonged to the princeâ\\x80\\x99s household. She had\\ncharge of the palace at Frascati, which was never occupied except by a\\nsolitary ecclesiastic, the princeâ\\x80\\x99s brother, for whom the first-floor\\nwas kept sacred. Even this sanctity, however, was sometimes invaded when\\na good chance offered of letting the _piano nobile_ to some rich\\nforeigner, which was the fate of all the other apartments in the house.\\nSora Antonia had charge of all the interests of the Savvelli in their\\ndeserted mansion. When the tenants did any damage she made careful note\\nof it, and did not in any respect neglect the interests of her master;\\nnor was she inconsiderate of her own, but regarded it as a natural duty,\\nwhen it proved expedient, to make a little money out of the Forestieri.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThey give one trouble enough, the blessed Madonna knows,â\\x80\\x9d the good\\nwoman said piously. But, notwithstanding these prudent cares, Sora\\nAntonia was not only a very sensible woman according to her lights, but\\nhad a heart, and understood her duty to her neighbours. She made her\\nsalutations to the two friends when they entered with equal suavity, but\\naddressed her explanations to Colin, who was not only her favourite in\\nright of his youth and good looks, but made out her meaning more easily\\nthan his companion. The crisis was an important one, and Sora Antonia\\nconducted herself accordingly; as soon as she had made her salutations\\nshe resumed her seat, which in itself was an act requiring explanation,\\nespecially as the table had been already arranged for dinner, and this\\nwas the last day in the world on which the strangers were likely to\\ndesire society. Sora Antonia took matters with a high hand, and in case\\nof opposition secured for herself at least the first word.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPardon, caro Signore mio,â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cyou are surprised to find me\\nhere. Very well; I am sorry to incommode the gentlemen, but I have to do\\nmy duty. The Signorina is very young, and she has no one to take care of\\nher. The Signori are very good, very excellent, and kind. Ah yes, I know\\nit--never was there such devotion to the poor sick friend; nevertheless,\\nthe Signori are but men, _senza complimenti_, and I am a woman who has\\nbeen married and had children of my own, and know my duty. Until some\\nproper person comes to take charge of the poor dear young lady, the\\nSignori will pardon me, but I must remain here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDoes the Signorina wish it?â\\x80\\x9d asked Colin, with wondering looks, for the\\nidea of another protector for Alice confounded him, he scarcely knew\\nwhy.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe Signorina is not much more than a child,â\\x80\\x9d said Sora Antonia,\\nloftily. â\\x80\\x9cBesides, she has not been brought up like an Italian young\\nlady, to know what is proper. Poverina! she does not understand anything\\nabout it; but the Signori will excuse me--I know my duty, and that is\\nenough.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes, certainly,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut then, in England, as you say, we\\nhave different ideas; and if the Signorina does not wish----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHere, however, he was interrupted by Lauderdale, who, having tardily\\napprehended the purport of Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s communication, took it upon\\nhimself to make instant response in the best Italian he could muster.\\nâ\\x80\\x9c_Avete molto buono, molto buono!_â\\x80\\x9d cried Lauderdale, intending to say\\nthat she was very kind, and that he highly approved, though a chronic\\nconfusion in his mind, as to which was which of the auxiliary verbs,\\nmade his meaning cloudy. â\\x80\\x9c_Grazie, Abbiamo contento! Grazie_,â\\x80\\x9d he added,\\nwith a little excitement and enthusiasm. Though he had used the wrong\\nverb, Sora Antonia graciously comprehended his meaning. She was used to\\nsuch little eccentricities of diction on the part of the Forestieri. She\\nbowed her stately head to him with a look of approbation; and it would\\nbe vain to deny that the sense of having thus expressed himself clearly\\nand eloquently in a foreign language conveyed a certain satisfaction to\\nthe mind of the philosopher.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBravo! The Signore will talk very well if he perseveres,â\\x80\\x9d said Sora\\nAntonia, graciously; â\\x80\\x9cnot to say that his Excellency is a man of\\nexperience, and perceives the justice of what I but propose. No doubt,\\nit will occupy a great deal of my time, but the other Forestieri have\\nnot arrived yet, and how can one expect the Madonna Santissima and the\\nblessed St. Antonio to take so much trouble in oneâ\\x80\\x99s concerns if one\\nwill not exert oneâ\\x80\\x99s self a little for oneâ\\x80\\x99s fellow-creatures? As the\\nSignorina has not left her room yet, I will take away the\\ninconvenience[2] for a few minutes. Scusa Signori,â\\x80\\x9d said Sora Antonia,\\nand she went away with stately bearing and firm steps which resounded\\nthrough the house, to take off her veil and put aside her rosary. She\\nhad seated herself again in her indoor aspect, with the â\\x80\\x9cGarden of the\\nSoulâ\\x80\\x9d in her hand, before Alice came into the room; and, without doubt,\\nshe made a striking addition to the party. She was a Frascati woman\\nborn, and her costume consequently, was perfect--a costume not so\\nbrilliant in any of its details as that scarlet jacket of Albano, which\\nis the most generally known of contadina dresses; but not less\\ncalculated to do justice to the ample bust and stately head of the Roman\\npeasant. The dress itself, the actual gown, in this as in other Italian\\ncostumes, was an indifferent matter. The important particulars were the\\nlong and delicate apron of embroidered muslin, the _busto_ made of rich\\nbrocade and shaped to the exact Frascati model, and the large, soft,\\nsnowy kerchief with embroidered corners, which covered her full\\nshoulders--not to speak of the long heavy gold ear-rings and coral\\nnecklace which completed and enriched the dress. She sat apart and\\ncontemplated, if not the â\\x80\\x9cGarden of the Soul,â\\x80\\x9d at least the little\\npictures in borders of lace-paper which were placed thickly between the\\nleaves, while the melancholy meal was eaten at the table--for Sora\\nAntonia had _educazione_, and had not come to intrude upon the privacy\\nof her lodgers. Alice, for her part, made no remark upon the presence of\\nthis new guardian; she accepted it as she accepted everything else, as a\\nmatter of course, without even showing any painful sense of the\\ncircumstances which in Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s opinion made this last precaution\\nnecessary. Her two companions, the only friends she seemed to have in\\nthe world, bore vicariously on her account the pain of such a visible\\nreminder that she was here in a false position and had no legitimate\\nprotector; but Alice had not yet awaked to any such sense on her own\\nbehalf. She took her place at the table and tried to swallow a morsel,\\nand interested herself in the appetite of the others as if she had been\\ntheir mother. â\\x80\\x9cTry to eat something; it will make you ill if you do\\nnot,â\\x80\\x9d poor Alice said, in the abstraction and dead calm of her grief.\\nHer own feeling was that she had been lifted far away from them into an\\natmosphere of age and distance and a kind of sad superiority; and to\\nminister to some one was the grand condition under which Alice Meredith\\nlived. As to the personal suffering, which was confined to herself, that\\ndid not so much matter; she had not been used to much sympathy, and it\\ndid not occur to her to look for it. Consequently, the only natural\\nbusiness which remained to her was to take a motherly charge of her two\\ncompanions, and urge them to eat.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not to mind me,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with an attempt at a smile, after\\ndinner. â\\x80\\x9cThis is Sunday, to be sure; but, after to-day, you are just to\\ngo on as you used to do, and never mind. Thank you, I should like it\\nbetter. I shall always be here, you know, when you come back from Rome,\\nor wherever you wish to go. But you must not mind for me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nLauderdale and Colin exchanged looks almost without being aware of it.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you would like--somebody to be sent for--or something done?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale. He was a great deal more confused in having to suggest this\\nthan Alice was, who kept looking at him, her eyes dilated with weariness\\nand tears, yet soft and clear as the eyes of a child. He could not say\\nto her, in so many words, â\\x80\\x9cIt is impossible for you to remain with us.â\\x80\\x9d\\nAll he could do was to falter and hesitate, and grow confused, under\\nthe limpid, sorrowful look which she bent upon him from the distant\\nheaven of her resignation and innocence. â\\x80\\x9cYou would like your\\nfriends--somebody to be written to,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; and then, afraid\\nto have given her pain by the suggestion, went on hurriedly: â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m old\\nenough to be your father, and no a thought in my mind but to do you\\nservice,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cTell me what you would like best. Colin, thank God!\\nis strong, and has little need of me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take you home, or do whatever\\nyou please; for Iâ\\x80\\x99m old enough to be your father, my poor bairn!â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe tender-hearted philosopher, and drew near to her, and put out his\\nhand with an impulse of pitiful and protecting kindness which touched\\nthe heart of Alice, and yet filled her with momentary surprise. She, on\\nher own side, was roused a little, not to think of herself, but to\\nremember what appeared to her a duty unfulfilled.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, Mr. Lauderdale, Arthur said I might tell you,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice. â\\x80\\x9cPapa!\\nyou heard what he said about papa? I ought to write and tell him what\\nhas happened. Perhaps I ought to tell you from the beginning,â\\x80\\x9d she\\ncontinued, after composing herself a little. â\\x80\\x9cWe left home without his\\nconsent--indeed, he did not know. For dear Arthur,â\\x80\\x9d said the poor girl,\\nturning her appealing eyes from one to the other, could not approve of\\nhis ways. â\\x80\\x9cHe did something that Arthur thought was wrong. I cannot tell\\nyou about it,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice through her tears; â\\x80\\x9cit did not make so much\\ndifference to me. I think I ought to write and tell him, and that Arthur\\nforgave him at the last. Oh, tell me, please, what do you think I should\\ndo?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you would like to go home, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll take you home,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cHe\\ndid not mean ony harm, poor callant, but heâ\\x80\\x99s left an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 burden on\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo home!â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, with a slight shudder. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think I ought--do\\nyou think I must? I do not care for myself; but Mrs. Meredith, you\\nknow--â\\x80\\x9d she added with a momentary blush; and then the friends began to\\nperceive another unforeseen lion in the way.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of my own head,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, who took the whole charge of this\\nbusiness on himself, and would not permit Colin to interfere, â\\x80\\x9cI wrote\\nyour father a kind of a letter. If you are able to hear the--the\\nevent--which has left us aâ\\x80\\x99 mourning--named in common words, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll read\\nyou what I have written. Poor bairn, youâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99 young and awfuâ\\x80\\x99 tender\\nto have such affairs in hand! Are you sure you are able to bear it, and\\ncan listen to what I have said?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh, I have borne it,â\\x80\\x9d said poor Alice. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot deceive myself, nor\\nthink Arthur is still here. What does it matter then about saying it?\\nOh, yes, I can bear anything--there is only me to be hurt now, and it\\ndoesnâ\\x80\\x99t matter. It was very kind of you to write. I should like to know\\nwhat you have said.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin, who could do nothing else for her, put forward the arm-chair with\\nthe cushions towards the table, and Sora Antonia put down the â\\x80\\x9cGarden of\\nthe Soulâ\\x80\\x9d and drew a little nearer with her heavy, firm step, which\\nshook the house. She comprehended that something was going on which\\nwould tax the Signorinaâ\\x80\\x99s strength, and brought her solid, steady\\nsuccour to be in readiness. The pale little girl turned and smiled upon\\nthem both, as she took the chair Colin had brought her. She was herself\\nquite steady in her weakness and grief and loneliness. Sora Antonia was\\nnot wanted there; and Colin drew her aside to the window, where she told\\nhim all about the fireworks that were to be in the evening, and her\\nhopes that after a while the Signorina would be able to â\\x80\\x9cdistract\\nherselfâ\\x80\\x9d a little and recover her spirits; to which Colin assented\\ndutifully, watching from where he stood the pale looks of the friendless\\nyoung woman--friendless beyond disguise or possible self-deception, with\\na stepmother whom she blushed to mention reigning in her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house.\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s thoughts were many and tumultuous as he stood behind in the\\nwindow, watching Alice and listening to Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s description of\\nthe fireworks. Was it possible that perhaps his duty to his neighbour\\nrequired from him the most costly of all offerings, the rashest of all\\npossible actions? He stood behind, growing more and more excited in the\\nutter quiet. The thought that had dawned upon him under the ilex-trees\\ncame nearer and grew more familiar, and as he looked at it he seemed to\\nrecognise all that visible machinery of Providence bringing about the\\ngreat event which youth decides upon so easily. While this vision grew\\nbefore his mind, Alice was wiping off the tears which obliterated\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s letter even to her patient eyes; for, docile and dutiful as\\nshe was, it was yet terrible to read in calm distinct words, which put\\nthe matter beyond all doubt, the announcement of â\\x80\\x9cwhat had happened.â\\x80\\x9d\\nThis is what Lauderdale had said:--\\n\\n     â\\x80\\x9cSIR,--It is a great grief to me to inform you of an event for\\n     which I have no way of knowing whether you are prepared or not.\\n     Your son, Arthur Meredith, has been living here for the last three\\n     months in declining health, and on Thursday last died in great\\n     comfort and constancy of mind. It is not for me, a stranger, to\\n     offer vain words of consolation, but his end was such as any man\\n     might be well content to have, and he entered upon his new life\\n     joyfully, without any shadow on his mind. As far as love and\\n     friendship could soothe the sufferings that were inevitable, he had\\n     both; for his sister never left his bedside, and myself and my\\n     friend Colin Campbell were with him constantly, to his\\n     satisfaction. His sister remains under our care. I who write am no\\n     longer a young man, and know what is due to a young creature of her\\n     tender years; so that you may satisfy yourself she is safe until\\n     such time as you can communicate with me, which I will look for as\\n     soon as a reply is practicable, and in the meantime remain,\\n\\n                               â\\x80\\x9cYour sonâ\\x80\\x99s faithful friend and mourner,\\n\\n                                                       â\\x80\\x9cW. LAUDERDALE.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlice lingered over this letter, reading it, and crying, and whispering\\nto Lauderdale a long time, as Colin thought. She found it easier,\\nsomehow, to tell her story fully to the elder man. She told him that\\nMrs. Meredith had â\\x80\\x9ccome home suddenly,â\\x80\\x9d which was her gentle version of\\na sad domestic history,--that nobody had known of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s second\\nmarriage until the stepmother arrived, without any warning, with a train\\nof children. Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s mild words did not give Lauderdale any very lively\\npicture of the dismay of the household at the unlooked-for apparition,\\nbut he understood enough to condemn Arthur less severely than he had\\nbeen disposed to do. This sudden catastrophe had happened just after the\\nother misery of the bank failure, which had ruined so many; and poor\\nMeredith had no alternative between leaving his sister to the tender\\nmercies of an underbred and possibly disreputable stepmother, or\\nbringing her with him when he retired to die; and Alice, though she\\nstill cried for â\\x80\\x9cpoor papa,â\\x80\\x9d recoiled a little from the conclusion of\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s letter. â\\x80\\x9cI have enough to live upon,â\\x80\\x9d she said, softly,\\nwith an appealing glance at her companion. â\\x80\\x9cIf you were to say that I\\nwas quite safe, would not that be enough?â\\x80\\x9d and it was very hard for\\nLauderdale to convince her that her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s judgment must be appealed\\nto in such a matter. When she saw he was not to be moved on this point,\\nshe sighed and submitted; but it was clearly apparent that as yet,\\noccupied as she was by her grief, the idea that her situation here was\\nembarrassing to her companions or unsuitable for herself had not\\noccurred to Alice. When she retired, under the escort of Sora Antonia,\\nthe two friends had a consultation over this perplexing matter; and\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s sketch--filled in, perhaps, a little from his\\nimagination--of the home she had left, plunged Colin into deeper and\\ndeeper thought. â\\x80\\x9cNo doubt heâ\\x80\\x99ll send some answer,â\\x80\\x9d the philosopher said.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe may not be worthy to have the charge of her, but heâ\\x80\\x99s aye her\\nfather. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to ken whether itâ\\x80\\x99s better or worse that she should be\\nso unconscious of anything embarrassing in her position; which is aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nmore wonderful, as sheâ\\x80\\x99s a real honest woman, and no way intellectual\\nnor exalted. You and me, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, looking up in his\\nyoung companionâ\\x80\\x99s face, â\\x80\\x9cmust take good care that she does not find it\\nout from us.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOf course,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with involuntary testiness; â\\x80\\x9cbut I do not see\\nwhat her father has to do with it,â\\x80\\x9d continued the young man. â\\x80\\x9cShe cannot\\npossibly return to such a home.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHer father is the best judge of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cshe canna\\nremain with you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd there the conversation dropped--but not the subject. Colin was not\\nin love with Alice; he had, indeed, vague but bright in the clouds\\nbefore him, an altogether different ideal woman; and his heart was in\\nthe career which he again saw opening before him--the life in which he\\nmeant to serve God and his country, and which at the present moment\\nwould admit of no rashly formed ties. Was it in consequence of these\\nhindrances that this new thing loomed so large before Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ninexperienced eyes? If he had longed for it with youthful passion, he\\nwould have put force on himself and restrained his longing; but the\\ntemptation took another shape. It was as if a maiden knight at the\\noutset of his career had been tempted to pass by a helpless creature and\\nleave her wrongs unredressed. The young Bayard could do anything but\\nthis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\\n\\n\\nIn the meantime at least a fortnight must pass before they could expect\\nan answer to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s letter. During that time they returned to all\\ntheir old habits, with the strange and melancholy difference, that\\nArthur, once the centre of all, was no longer there. Every day of this\\ntime increased the development of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s new thoughts, until the\\nunknown father of Alice had grown, in his eyes, into a cruel and\\nprofligate tyrant, ready to drag his daughter home and plunge her into\\ndepraved society without any regard for either her happiness or her\\nhonour. Colin had, indeed, in his own mind, in strictest privacy and\\nseclusion of thought, indited an imaginary letter, eloquent with\\nyouthful indignation, to inform this unworthy parent that his deserted\\ndaughter had found a better protector; but he was very silent about\\nthese cogitations of his, and did not share them even with Lauderdale.\\nAnd there were moments when Colin felt the seriousness of the position,\\nand thought it very hard that such a necessity should meet him in the\\nface at the beginning of his career. Sometimes in the sudden darkening,\\nout of the rosy clouds which hung over the Campagna, the face of the\\nimpossible woman, the ideal creature--she who could have divined the\\nthoughts in his mind and the movements in his heart before they came\\ninto being, would glance suddenly out upon him for an instant, and then\\ndisappear, waving a shadowy farewell, and leaving in his mind a strange\\nblank, which the sight of Alice rather increased than removed. That\\nineffable mate and companion was never to be his, the young man thought.\\nTrue, he had never met her, nor come upon any trace of her footsteps,\\nfor Matty Frankland at her best never could have been she. But yet, as\\nlong as he was unbound by other tie or affection, this vision was the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cnot impossible Sheâ\\x80\\x9d to Colin as to all men; and this he had to give\\nup--for Alice, dutiful and sweet Alice, forsaken by all friends and yet\\nso steadfast in her gentle self-possession, whom it was not in the heart\\nof man to be otherwise than tender of; she who had need of him, and whom\\nhis very nature bound him to protect and cherish--was not that woman. At\\nother moments he thought of his own life, for which still so much\\ntraining was necessary, and which he should have entered in the full\\nfreedom of his youth; and was profoundly aware of the incumbered and\\nhelpless trim in which he must go into the battle, obliged to take\\nthought not of his work only, and the best means of doing it, but of\\nthose cares of living which lie so lightly on a young man alone.\\n\\nThere may be some of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friends who will think the less of him for\\nthis struggle in his mind; and there may be many who will think with\\njustice that, unless he could have offered love to Alice, he had no\\nright to offer her himself and his life--an opinion in which his\\nhistorian fully agrees. But then this gift though less than the best,\\nwas a long way superior to anything else which, at the present moment,\\nwas likely to be offered to the friendless girl. If he could have laid\\nat her feet the full heart, which is the only true offering under such\\ncircumstances, the chances are that Alice, in her simplicity and\\ngentleness, would have been sadly puzzled what to do with that\\npassionate and ungovernable thing. What he really could offer\\nher--affection, tenderness, protection--was clearly comprehensible to\\nher. She had no other idea of love than was included in those attributes\\nand phases of it. These considerations justified Colin in the step which\\nhe contemplated--or rather in the step which he did not contemplate, but\\nfelt to be necessary and incumbent upon him. It sometimes occurred to\\nhim how--if he had been prudent and taken Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s advice, and\\neschewed at the beginning that close connexion with Meredith and his\\nsister, which he had entered into with his eyes open, and with a\\nconsciousness even that it might affect his life--this embarrassing\\nsituation might never have come into being; and then he smiled to\\nhimself, with youthful superiority, contemplating what seemed so plainly\\nthe meaning of Providence, and asking himself how he, by a momentary\\nexercise of his own will, could have overthrown that distinct celestial\\nintention? On the whole, it was comforting to think that everything had\\nbeen arranged beforehand by agencies so very clear and traceable; and\\nwith this conclusion of the argument he left off, as near contented as\\npossible, and not indisposed to enjoy the advantages which were palpably\\nbefore him; for, though they were not the eyes he had dreamed of, there\\nwas a sweetness very well worthy of close study in Alice Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s\\neyes.\\n\\nThe days passed very quietly in this time of suspense. The society of\\nthe two strangers, who were more to her in her sorrow than all her\\nkindred, supported the lonely girl more than she was aware of--more than\\nany one could have believed. They were absent during the greater part of\\nthe day, and left her unmolested to the tears that would come,\\nnotwithstanding all her patience; and they returned to her in the\\nevening with attention and cares to which she had never been accustomed,\\ndevoting two original and powerful minds, of an order at once higher and\\nmore homely than any which she had ever encountered, to her amusement\\nand consolation. Alice had never known before what it was to have\\nordinary life and daily occurrences brightened by the thick-coming\\nfancies, the tender play of word and thought, which now surrounded her.\\nShe had heard clever talk afar off, â\\x80\\x9cin society,â\\x80\\x9d and been awe-stricken\\nby the sound of it; and she had heard Arthur and his friends uttering\\nmuch fine-sounding language upon subjects not generally in her way; but\\nshe was utterly unused to that action of uncommon minds upon common\\nthings which gives so much charm to the ordinary intercourse of life.\\nAll they could think of to lighten the atmosphere of the house in which\\nshe sat in her deep mourning, absorbed for hours together in those\\nthoughts of the dead to which her needlework afforded little relief,\\nthey did with devotion, suspending their own talk and occupations to\\noccupy themselves with her. Colin read _In Memoriam_ to her till her\\nheart melted and relieved itself in sweet abundant tears; and Lauderdale\\ntalked and told her many a homely history of that common course of\\nhumanity, full of sorrows sorer than her own, which fills young minds\\nwith awe. Between them they roused Alice to a higher platform, a\\ndifferent atmosphere, than she had known before; and she raised herself\\nup after them with a half-bewildered sense of elevation, not\\nunderstanding how it was; and so the long days which were so hard, and\\nwhich nothing in the world could save from being hard, brightened\\ntowards the end, not certainly into anything that could be called\\npleasure, but into a sad expansion and elevation of heart, in which\\nfaintly appeared those beginnings of profound and deep happiness which\\nare not incompatible with grief, and yet are stronger and more inspiring\\nthan joy.\\n\\nWhile this was going on, unconsciously to any one concerned, Sora\\nAntonia, in her white kerchief and apron, sometimes knitting, sometimes\\nwith her distaff like a buxom Fate, sat and twisted her thread and\\nturned her spindle a little behind yet not out of reach, keeping a wary\\neye upon her charge. She too interposed, sometimes with her own comments\\nupon life and things in general, and took part in the conversation; and,\\nwhether it was that Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s mind was really of a superior order,\\nor that the stately Roman speech threw a refining colour upon her\\nnarratives, it is certain that the interpellations of the Italian\\npeasant fell without any sensible derogation into the strain of lofty\\nyet familiar talk which was meant to wean Alice from her special grief.\\nSora Antonia told them of the other Forestieri who had lived like\\nthemselves in the Savelli palace; who had come for health and yet had\\ndied, leaving the saddest mourners--helpless widows and little children,\\nheart-broken fathers and mothers, perhaps the least consolable of all.\\nLife was such, she said solemnly, bowing her stately head. She herself,\\nof a hardy race, and strong, as the Signori saw, had not she buried her\\nchildren, for whom she would have gladly died? But the good God had not\\npermitted her to die. Alice cried silently as she heard all this; she\\nkissed Sora Antonia, who, for her part, had outlived her tears, and with\\na natural impulse turned to Colin, who was young, and in whose heart, as\\nin her own, there must live a natural protest against this awful\\nnecessity of separation and misery; and thus it came to be Colinâ\\x80\\x99s turn\\nto interpose, and he came on the field once more with _In memoriam_, and\\nwith other poems which were sweet to hear, and soothed her even when she\\nonly partially entered into their meaning. A woman has an advantage\\nunder such circumstances. By means of her sympathy and gratitude, and\\nthe still deeper feeling which grew unconsciously in her heart towards\\nhim who read, she came to believe that she too understood and\\nappreciated what was to him so clear and so touching. A kind of\\nspiritual magnetism worked upon Alice, and, to all visible appearance,\\nexpanded and enlarged her mind. It was not that her intellect itself\\ngrew, or that she understood all the beautiful imaginations, all the\\ntender philosophies thus unfolded to her; but she was united in a\\nsingular union of affectionate companionship with those who did\\nunderstand, and even to herself she appeared able to see, if not with\\nher own eyes, at least with theirs, the new beauties and solemnities of\\nwhich she had not dreamt before.\\n\\nThis strange process went on day by day without any one being aware of\\nit; and even Lauderdale had almost forgotten that their guardianship of\\nAlice was only for the moment, and that the state of affairs altogether\\nwas provisionary and could not possibly continue, when an answer reached\\nhim to his letter. He was alone when he received it, and all that\\nevening said nothing on the subject until Alice had retired with her\\nwatchful attendant; then, without a word of comment, he put it into\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s hand. It was written in a stilted hand, like that of one\\nunaccustomed to writing, and was not quite irreproachable even in its\\nspelling. This was what Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s correspondent said:--\\n\\n     â\\x80\\x9cSIR,--Your letter has had such a bad effect upon the health of my\\n     dear husband, that I beg you wonâ\\x80\\x99t trouble him with any more such\\n     communications. If itâ\\x80\\x99s meant to get money, thatâ\\x80\\x99s vain--for\\n     neither him nor me knows anything about the friends Arthur may have\\n     picked up. If he had stayed at home he would have received every\\n     attention. As for his ungrateful sister, I wonâ\\x80\\x99t have anything to\\n     say to her. Mr. Meredith is very ill, and, for anything I know, may\\n     never rise from a bed of sickness, where he has been thrown by\\n     hearing this news so sudden; but I take upon me to let her know as\\n     he will have nothing to say to one that could behave so badly as\\n     she has done. I am always for making friends, but she knows she\\n     cannot expect much kindness from me after all that has happened.\\n     She has money enough to live on, and she can do as she pleases.\\n     Considering what her ingratitude has brought her dear father to,\\n     and that I may be left alone to manage everything before many days\\n     are past, you will please to consider that here is an end of it,\\n     and not write any more begging letters to me.\\n\\n                                                      â\\x80\\x9cJULIA MEREDITH.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n\\nThis communication Colin read with a beating heart. It was so different\\nfrom what he expected, and left him so free to carry out the dawning\\nresolution which he had imagined himself executing in the face of\\ntyrannical resistance, that he felt at first like a man who has been\\nstraining hard at a rope and is suddenly thrown down by the\\ninstantaneous stoppage of the pressure on the other side. When he had\\npicked himself up, the facts of the case rushed on him distinct and\\nunmistakeable. The time had now come when the lost and friendless maiden\\nstood in the path of the true knight. Was he to leave her there to fight\\nher way in the hard world by herself, without defence or protection,\\nbecause, sweet and fair and pure as she was, she was not the lady of his\\ndreams? He made up his mind at once with a thrill of generous warmth;\\nbut at the same time felt himself saying for ever and ever farewell to\\nthat ideal lady who henceforward, in earth or heaven, could never be\\nhis. All this passed through his mind while he was looking at the letter\\nwhich already his rapid eye had read and his mind comprehended. â\\x80\\x9cSo\\nthere is an end of your hopes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cNow we are the only friends\\nshe has in the world--as I have always thought.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSoftly,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cCallants like you aye run away with the half\\nof an idea. This is an ignorant womanâ\\x80\\x99s letter, that is glad to get rid\\nof her. The father will mend, and then heâ\\x80\\x99ll take her out of our hands.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe shall do nothing of the kind,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, hotly. â\\x80\\x9cYou speak as if\\nshe was a piece of furniture; I look upon her as a sacred charge. We are\\nresponsible to Meredith for his sisterâ\\x80\\x99s comfort and--happiness,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe young man, who during this conversation preferred not to meet his\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x99s eye.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy!â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale drily, â\\x80\\x9cthatâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 charge for the like of you\\nand me. Itâ\\x80\\x99s more that I ever calculated on, Colin. To see her safe\\nhome, and in the hands of her friends----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLauderdale, do not be so heartless; cannot you see that she has no\\nfriends?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin; â\\x80\\x9cnot a protector in the world except----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCallant, dinna deceive yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s no a matter\\nfor hasty judgment; we have nae right to pass sentence on a manâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncharacter. Heâ\\x80\\x99s her father, and itâ\\x80\\x99s her duty to obey him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nheeding about that silly womanâ\\x80\\x99s letter. Mr. Meredith will mend. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nhere to take care of you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s guardian. â\\x80\\x9cColin, hold your\\npeace. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no to do for a momentâ\\x80\\x99s excitement, for pity and ruth and\\nyour own tender heart, what you may regret all your life. Sit down and\\nkeep still. You are only a callant, too young to take burdens on\\nyourself; there is but one way that the like of you can protect the like\\nof her--and that is no to be thought of, as you consented with your own\\nmouth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am aware of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who had risen up in his excitement.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere is but one way. Matters have changed since we spoke of it first.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI would like to know how far they have changed,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColin, take heed to what I say; if itâ\\x80\\x99s love Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no speak a word; I\\nmay disapprove aâ\\x80\\x99 the circumstances, and find fault with every step ye\\ntake; but if itâ\\x80\\x99s love----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, standing upright, and meeting his friendâ\\x80\\x99s eye; â\\x80\\x9cif\\nit should happen to be my future wife we are speaking of, my feelings\\ntowards her are not to be discussed with any man in the world.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThey looked at each other thus for a moment, the one anxious and\\nscrutinizing, the other facing him with blank brightness, and a smile\\nwhich afforded no information. Perhaps Lauderdale understood all that\\nwas implied in that blank; at all events, his own delicate sense of\\nhonour could not refuse to admit Colinâ\\x80\\x99s plea. He turned away, shaking\\nhis head, and groaning privately under his breath; while Colin, struck\\nwith compunction, having shut himself up for an instant, unfolded again,\\nthat crisis being over, with all the happy grace of apology natural to\\nhis disposition. â\\x80\\x9cYou are not â\\x80\\x98any man in the world,â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d he said with a\\nshort laugh, which implied emotion. â\\x80\\x9cForgive me, Lauderdale; and now you\\nknow very well what I am going to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh ay, I ken what you are going to do; I kent three months ago, for\\nthat matter,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher. â\\x80\\x9cA man acts no from circumstances,\\nas is generally supposed, but from his ain nature.â\\x80\\x9d When he had given\\nforth this oracular utterance, Lauderdale went straight off to his room\\nwithout exchanging another word with Colin. He was satisfied to a\\ncertain extent with such a mate for his friend, and belonged to too\\nlowly a level of society to give profound importance to the inexpediency\\nof early marriages--and he was fond of Alice, and admired her sweet\\nlooks and sweet ways, and respected her self-command and patience;\\nnevertheless, he too sighed, and recognised the departure of the ideal\\nwoman, who to him as little as to Colin resembled Alice;--and thus it\\nwas understood between them how it was to be.\\n\\nAll this, it may be imagined, was little compatible with that\\nreverential regard for womankind in general which both the friends\\nentertained, and evidenced a security in respect to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s inclinations\\nwhich was not altogether complimentary to her. And yet it was highly\\ncomplimentary in a sense; for their security arose from their\\nappreciation of the spotless unawakened heart with which they had to do.\\nIf Colin entertained little doubt of being accepted when he made his\\nproposal, it was not because he had an overweening idea of himself, or\\nimagined Alice â\\x80\\x9cin loveâ\\x80\\x9d with him according to the vulgar expression. A\\ncertain chivalrous, primitive sense of righteous and natural necessity\\nwas in his confidence. The forlorn maiden, knowing the knight to be\\nhonest and true, would accept his protection loyally and simply, without\\nbewildering herself with dreams of choice where no choice was; and\\nhaving accepted would love and cleave as was her nature. To be sure\\nthere were types of woman less acquiescent; and we have already said\\nthat Alice did not bear the features of that ideal of which Colin had\\ndreamed; but such was the explanation of his confidence. Alice showed\\nlittle distress when she saw her stepmotherâ\\x80\\x99s letter except on account\\nof her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s illness; though even that seemed rather consolatory to\\nher than otherwise, as a proof of his love for Arthur. As for Mrs.\\nMeredithâ\\x80\\x99s refusal to interfere on her behalf, she was clearly relieved\\nby the intimation; and things went on as before for another week or two,\\nuntil Sora Antonia, who had now other tenants arriving and many\\noccupations in hand, began to murmur a little over the watch which she\\nwould not relinquish. â\\x80\\x9cIs it thus young ladies are left in England?â\\x80\\x9d she\\nasked, with a little indignation, â\\x80\\x9cwithout any one to take care of them\\nexcept the Signori, who, though amiable and excellent, are only men? or\\nwhen may the lady be expected from England who is to take charge of the\\nSignorina?â\\x80\\x9d It was after this question, had been put to him with some\\nforce one evening, that Colin proposed to Alice, who was beginning to\\nlift her head again like a flower after a storm, and to show symptoms of\\nawaking from the first heaviness of grief, to go out with him and visit\\nthose ilex avenues, which had now so many associations for the\\nstrangers. She went with a faint sense of pleasure in her heart through\\nthe slanting sunshine, looking wistfully through her black veil at the\\nmany cheerful groups on the way, and clinging to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s arm when a kind\\nneighbour spoke to her in pity and condolence. She put up her veil when\\nthey came to the favourite avenue, where Lauderdale and Colin walked so\\noften. Nothing could be more silent, more cool and secluded than this\\nverdant cloister, where, with the sunshine still blazing everywhere\\naround, the shade and quiet were profound and unbroken. They walked once\\nor twice up and down, remarking now and then upon the curious network of\\nbranches, which, out of reach of the sun, were all bare and stripped of\\ntheir foliage--and upon the blue blaze of daylight at either opening,\\nwhere the low arch of dark verdure framed in a span of brilliant Italian\\nsky. Then they both became silent, and grew conscious of it; and it was\\nat that moment, just as Alice for the first time began to remember the\\nprivileges and penalties of her womanhood, that Colin spoke,--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI brought you here to speak to you,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI have a great deal to\\nsay. That letter that Lauderdale showed you did not grieve you, did it?\\nYou must tell me frankly. Arthur made me one of your guardians, and,\\nwhatever you may decide upon, that is a sacred bond.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, oh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, with tears, â\\x80\\x9cI know how kind you both are.\\nNo, it did not grieve me, except about papa. I was rather glad, if I may\\nsay so, that she did not send for me home. It is not--a--home--like what\\nit used to be,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice; and then, perhaps because something in\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s looks had advertised her of what was coming; perhaps because of\\nthe awakening sense of her position sprang up in a moment, after long\\ntorpor--a sudden change came upon her face. â\\x80\\x9cI have given you a great\\ndeal of trouble,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cI am like somebody who has had a terrible\\nfall--as soon as I come to myself I will go away. It is very wrong of me\\nto detain you here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are not detaining us,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who, notwithstanding, was a\\nlittle startled and alarmed; â\\x80\\x9cand you must not talk of going away.\\nWhere would you go? Are not we your friends--the friends you know best\\nin Italy? You must not _think_ of going away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut even these very words thus repeated acted like an awakening spell\\nupon Alice. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot tell what I have been thinking of,â\\x80\\x9d she said. â\\x80\\x9cI\\nsuppose it is staying indoors and forgetting everything. I do not seem\\nto know even how long it is. Oh yes, you are my kindest friends. Nobody\\never was so good to me; but, then, you are only--gentlemen!â\\x80\\x9d said Alice,\\nsuddenly withdrawing her hand from Colinâ\\x80\\x99s arm, and blushing over all\\nher pallid face. â\\x80\\x9cAh! I see now how stupid I have been to put off so\\nlong. And I am sure I must have detained you here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cdo not say so; but I have something more to say to\\nyou. You are too young and too delicate to face the world alone, and\\nyour people at home are not going to claim you. I am a poor man now, and\\nI never can be rich, but I would protect you and support you if you\\nwould have me. Will you trust me to take care of you, Alice, not for\\nthis moment, but always? I think it would be the best thing for us\\nboth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Campbell, I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand you,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, trembling and\\ncasting a glance up at him of wistful surprise and uncertainty. There\\nwas an eager, timid inquiry in her eyes beside the bewilderment. She\\nseemed to say, â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it you mean? Is _that_ what you mean?â\\x80\\x9d and Colin\\nanswered by taking her hand again and drawing it through his arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhether you will have me or not,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cthere is always the bond\\nbetween us which Arthur has made sacred, and you must lean on me all the\\nsame. I think you will see what I mean if you consider it. There is only\\none way that I can be your true protector and guardian, and that is if\\nyou will consent to marry me, Alice. Will you? You know I have nothing\\nto offer you; but I can work for you, and take care of you, and with me\\nyou would not be alone.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was a strange way of putting it, certainly--very different from what\\nColin had intended to say, strangely different from the love-tale that\\nhad glided through his imagination by times since he became a man; but\\nhe was very earnest and sincere in what he said, and the innocent girl\\nbeside him was no critic in such matters. She trembled more and more,\\nbut she leaned upon him and heard him out with anxious attention. When\\nhe had ended, there was a pause, during which Colin, who had not\\nhitherto been doubtful, began himself to feel anxious; and then Alice\\nonce more gave a wistful, inquiring look at his face.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be angry with me,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cit is so hard to know what to\\nanswer. If you would tell me one thing quite truly and frankly--Would it\\nnot do you a great deal of harm if this was to happen as you say?----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. When he said the word he could not help remembering,\\nin spite of himself, the change it would make in his young prospects,\\nbut the result was only that he repeated his negative with more warmth.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt can do me only good,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, yielding to the natural\\ntemptations of the moment, â\\x80\\x9cand I think I might do something for your\\nhappiness too. It is for you to decide--do not decide against me,\\nAlice,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man; â\\x80\\x9cI cannot part with you now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh!--â\\x80\\x9d said Alice with a long breath. â\\x80\\x9cIf it only would not do you any\\nharm,â\\x80\\x9d she added a moment after, once more with that inquiring look. The\\ninquiry was one which could be answered but in one way, and Colin was\\nnot a man to remain unmoved by the wistful, sweet eyes thus raised to\\nhim, and by the tender dependence of the clinging arm. He set her doubts\\nat rest almost as eloquently, and quite as warmly, as if she had indeed\\nbeen that woman who had disappeared among the clouds for ever; and led\\nher home to Sora Antonia with a fond care, which was very sweet to the\\nforlorn little maiden, and not irksome by any means to the magnanimous\\nknight. Thus the decisive step was taken in obedience to the necessities\\nof the position, and the arrangements (as Colin had decided upon them)\\nof Providence. When he met Lauderdale and informed him of the new event,\\nthe young man looked flushed and happy, as was natural in the\\ncircumstances, and disposed of all the objections of prudence with great\\nfacility and satisfaction to himself. It was a moonlight night, and\\nColin and his friend went out to the _loggia_ on the roof of the house,\\nand plunged into a sea of discussion, through which the young lover\\nsteered triumphantly the frailest bark of argument that ever held water.\\nBut, when the talk was over, and Colin, before he followed Lauderdale\\ndownstairs, turned round to take a parting look at the Campagna, which\\nlay under them like a great map in the moonlight, the old apparition\\nlooked out once more from the clouds, pale and distant, and again seemed\\nto wave to him a shadowy farewell. â\\x80\\x9cFarewell! farewell! not in heaven\\nnor in earth shall you ever find me,â\\x80\\x9d sighed the woman of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nimagination, dispersing into thin white mists and specks of clouds; and\\nthe young man went to rest with a vague sense of loss in his heart. The\\nsleep of Alice was sweeter than that of Colin on this first night of\\ntheir betrothal; but at that one period of existence, it often happens\\nthat the woman, for once in her life, has the advantage. And thus it was\\nthat the event, foreseen by Lauderdale on board the steamer at the\\nbeginning of their acquaintance, actually came to pass.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\\n\\n\\nThis important decision, when at last finally settled, necessitated\\nother steps more embarrassing and difficult than anything that could be\\ndiscussed in the ilex avenue. Even Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s protection ceased to\\nbe altogether satisfactory to the suddenly-awakened mind of Alice, who\\nat the same time was so unaccustomed to think or act for herself that\\nshe knew not what to do in the emergency. If Colin had been the kind of\\nman who would have decided for her at once, and indicated what he\\nthought she ought to do, Alice was the kind of woman to act steadily and\\nbravely upon the indication. But, unfortunately, Colin did not\\nunderstand how to dictate to a woman, having known most intimately of\\nall womankind his mother, who was treated after an altogether different\\nfashion; and Lauderdale, though sufficiently aware of the embarrassing\\nnature of their position, belonged, notwithstanding his natural\\nrefinement, to a class which sets no great store by punctilio. Now that\\neverything was settled between the â\\x80\\x9cyoung folk,â\\x80\\x9d Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s unprotected\\nstate did not distress him so much as formerly. The marriage, which must\\ntake place immediately, was already in his eyes a sufficient shelter for\\nthe solitary girl; and the indecorum of the whole business no longer\\noccurred to him. As for Colin, he, as was natural, regarded with a\\ncertain excitement the strange step he was about to take, not knowing\\nwhat anybody would think of it, nor how he was to live with his bride,\\nnor what influence an act so unsuitable to his circumstances would have\\nupon his prospects and position. It was of a piece with the rashness and\\nvisionary character of the whole transaction, that Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s money, which\\nshe had herself recurred to as â\\x80\\x9cenough to live upon,â\\x80\\x9d never entered into\\nthe calculations of the young man who was going to marry on his\\nscholarship, without being at all convinced in his own mind that his\\nscholarship could be held by a married man. A married man!--the title\\nhad an absurd sound as applied to himself, even in his own ears. He was\\njust over one-and-twenty, and had not a penny in the world. But these\\nconsiderations, after all, had not half so much effect upon him as the\\nthought of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s grave countenance when she should read his next\\nletter, and the displeasure of his father, who perhaps already regarded\\nwith a not altogether satisfied eye the spectacle of a son of his gone\\nabroad for his health. If Colin could but have made sure of the nature\\nof the reception he was likely to meet with at Ramore, prudential\\nconsiderations of any other character would have had but a momentary\\nweight; but at present, amid his other perplexities, the young man felt\\na certain boyish confusion at the thought of asking his mother to\\nreceive and recognise his wife. However, the important letter had been\\nwritten, and was on its way, and he could only hope that his previous\\nletters had prepared the household for that startling intimation. Apart\\nfrom Ramore, the matter had a less serious aspect; for Colin, who had\\nbeen poor all his life, no more believed in poverty than if he had been\\na prince, and had a certain instinctive certainty of getting what he\\nneeded, which belonged to his youth. Besides, he was not a poor\\ngentleman, hampered, and helpless, but knew, at the worst, that he could\\nalways work for his wife.\\n\\nAt the same time, in the midst of all the seriousness of the\\nposition--with all his tender affection for Alice, and reverence for her\\nhelplessness, and even notwithstanding that inexpressible blank and\\nsense of disappointment in his heart which even his affection could not\\nquite neutralize,--a curious sense of humour, and feeling that the whole\\nmatter was a kind of practical joke on a grand scale, intruded into\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s ideas from time to time, and made him laugh, and then made him\\nfurious with himself; for Alice, to be sure, saw no joke in the matter.\\nShe was, indeed, altogether wanting in a sense of humour, if even her\\ngrief would have permitted her to exercise it, and was sufficiently\\noccupied by the real difficulties of her position, secluding herself in\\nSora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s apartments, and wavering in an agony of timidity and\\nuncertainty over the idea of leaving that kind protector and going\\nsomewhere else, even though among strangers, in order to obey the\\nnecessary proprieties. She had not a soul to consult about what she\\nshould do except Sora Antonia herself and Lauderdale, neither of whom\\nnow thought it necessary to suggest a removal on the part of either of\\nthe young people; and though thoughts of going into Rome, and finding\\nsomebody who would give her shelter for a week or two till Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\narrangements were complete, hovered in the mind of Alice, she had no\\ncourage to carry out such an idea, being still in her first grief, poor\\nchild, although this new excitement had entered into her life.\\n\\nAs for Colin, affairs went much less easily with him when he betook\\nhimself to the English clergyman to ask his services. The inquiries\\ninstituted by this new judge were of a kind altogether unforeseen by the\\nthoughtless young man. To be sure, a mourning sister is not usually\\nmarried a few weeks after her brotherâ\\x80\\x99s death, and the questioner was\\njustified in thinking the circumstance strange. Nor was it at all\\ndifficult to elicit from Colin a story which, viewed by suspicious and\\nignorant eyes, threw quite a different colour on the business. The young\\nlady was the daughter of Mr. Meredith of Maltby, as the clergyman, who\\nhad laid Arthur in his grave, was already aware. She was young, under\\nage, and her father had not been consulted about her proposed marriage;\\nand she was at present entirely in the hands and under the influence of\\nthis young Scotchman, who, though his manners were considered\\nirreproachable by Miss Matty Frankland, who was a critic in manners,\\nstill lacked certain particulars in his general demeanour by which the\\nhigher class of Englishmen are distinguished. He took more interest in\\nthings in general, and was more transparent, more expressive than he\\nwould probably have been had he been entirely Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s equal; and he was\\nslightly wanting in calmness and that soft haze of impertinence which\\nsets off good breeding--in short, he had not the full ring of the\\ngenuine metal; and a man who lived in Rome, and was used to stories of\\nadventurers and interested marriages, not unnaturally jumped at the\\nconclusion that Colin (being a Scotchman beside, and consequently the\\nimpersonation, save the mark! of money-getting) was bent upon securing\\nto himself the poor little girlâ\\x80\\x99s fortune. Before the cross-examination\\nwas done Colin began somehow to feel himself a suspicious character; for\\nit is astonishing what an effect there is in that bland look of superior\\npenetration and air of seeing through a subject, however well aware the\\nperson under examination may be that his judge knows nothing about it.\\nThen the investigator turned the discussion upon pecuniary matters,\\nwhich after all was the branch of examination for which Colin was least\\nprepared.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Meredith has some fortune, I presume?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIs it at her own\\ndisposal? for on this, as well as on other matters, it appears to me\\nabsolutely necessary that her father should be consulted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have already told you that her father has been consulted,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin, with a little vexation, â\\x80\\x9cand you have seen the answer to my\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s letter. I have not the least idea what her fortune is, or if\\nshe has any. Yes, I recollect she said she had enough to live upon; but\\nit did not occur to me to make any inquiries on the subject,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung man; which more than ever confirmed his questioner that this was\\nnot a member of the higher class with whom he had to deal.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd you?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYour friends are aware, I presume--and your means\\nare sufficient to maintain--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who with difficulty restrained a smile, â\\x80\\x9cI have not\\nvery much; but I am quite able to work for my wife. It seems to me,\\nhowever, that this examination is more than I bargained for. If Miss\\nMeredith is satisfied on these points, that is surely enough--seeing,\\nunfortunately, that she has no one to stand by her--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon,â\\x80\\x9d said the clergyman, â\\x80\\x9cit is the duty of my office to\\nstand by her. I do not see that I can carry out your wishes--certainly\\nnot without having a conversation with the young lady. I cannot say that\\nI feel satisfied;--not that I blame you, of course,--but you are a very\\nyoung man, and your feelings, you know, being involved--however, my wife\\nand myself will see Miss Meredith, and you can call on me again.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, getting up; and then, after making a step or\\ntwo to the door, he returned. â\\x80\\x9cI am anxious to have everything concluded\\nthe earliest possible moment,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cPray do not lose any time. She\\nis very solitary, and has no proper protector,â\\x80\\x9d Colin continued, with an\\ningenuous flush on his face. He looked so young, so honest and earnest,\\nthat even experience was shaken for the moment by the sight of Truth.\\nBut then it is the business of experience to fence off Truth, and defy\\nthe impressions of Nature,--and so the representative of authority,\\nthough shaken for a moment, did not give in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBy the bye, I fear I did not understand you,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYou are not\\nliving in the same house? Considering all the circumstances, I cannot\\nthink that proper. Either she should find another home, or you should\\nleave the house,--any gentleman would have thought of that,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\npriest severely, perhaps by way of indemnifying himself for the passing\\nsentiment of kindness which had moved him. Colonâ\\x80\\x99s face grew crimson at\\nthese words. The idea flashed upon himself for the first time, and\\nfilled him with shame and confusion; but the young man had so far\\nattained that perfection of good breeding which is only developed by\\ncontact with men, that the reproof, which was just, did not irritate\\nhim,--a fact which once more made the clergyman waver in his opinion.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very true,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, confused, yet impulsive; â\\x80\\x9cthough I am\\nashamed to say I never thought of it before. We have all been so much\\noccupied with poor Arthur. But what you say is perfectly just, and I am\\nobliged to you for the suggestion. I shall take rooms in Rome to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which the two parted with more amity than could have been expected;\\nfor Colinâ\\x80\\x99s clerical judge was pleased to have his advice taken so\\nreadily, as was natural, and began to incline towards the opinion that a\\nyoung man who did not resent the imputation of having failed in a point\\nwhich â\\x80\\x9cany gentleman would have thought of,â\\x80\\x9d but confessed without\\nhesitation that it had not occurred to him, could be nothing less than a\\ngentleman. Notwithstanding, the first step taken by this sensible and\\nexperienced man was to write a letter by that dayâ\\x80\\x99s post to Mr. Meredith\\nof Maltby, informing him of the application Colin had just made. He knew\\nnothing against the young man, the reverend gentleman was good enough to\\nsay,--he was very young and well-looking, and had a good expression, and\\nmight be unexceptionable; but still, without her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s consent, Mr.\\nMeredith might rest assured _he_ would take no steps in the business.\\nWhen he had written this letter, the clergyman summoned his wife and\\ntook the trouble of going out to Frascati to see Alice, which he would\\nnot have done had he not been a just and kind man; while at the same\\ntime his heart was relenting to Colin, whom the clerical couple met in\\nthe street, and who took off his hat when he encountered them, without\\nthe least shadow of resentment. It is so long since all this happened\\nthat the name of the clergyman thus temporarily occupying the place of\\nthe chaplain at Rome has escaped recollection, and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s historian has\\nno desire to coin names or confuse identities. The gentleman in question\\nwas, it is supposed, an English rector taking his holiday. He went out\\nto Frascati, like an honourable and just person as he was, to see what\\nthe solitary girl was about, thus left to the chances of the world, and\\nfound Alice in the great _salone_ in her black dress, under charge of\\nSora Antonia, who sat with her white handkerchief on her ample\\nshoulders, twirling her spindle, and spinning, along with her thread,\\nmany a tale of chequered human existence, for the amusement of her\\ncharge; who, however, for the first time in her life, had begun to be\\nunconscious of what was said to her, and to spend her days in strains of\\nreverie all unusual to Alice--mingled dreams and intentions, dim\\npictures of the life that was to be, and purposes which were to be\\ncarried out therein. Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s stories, which required no answer,\\nwere very congenial to Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s state of mind; and now and then, a word\\nfrom the narrative fell into and gave a new direction to her thoughts.\\n\\nFrom all this she woke up with a little start when the English visitors\\nentered, and it was with difficulty she restrained the tears which came\\nin a choking flood when she recognised the clergyman. He had seen Arthur\\nrepeatedly during his illness, and had given him the sacrament, and laid\\nhim in his grave, and all the associations connected with him were too\\nmuch for her, although after Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s death the good man had forgotten\\nthe poor little mourning sister. When she recovered, however, Alice was\\nmuch more able to cope with her reverend questioner than Colin had\\nbeen--perhaps because she was a woman; perhaps because she had more of\\nthe ease of society; perhaps because in this matter at least her own\\nfeelings were more profound and unmixed than those of her young\\n_fiancÃ©_. She composed herself with an effort when he told her the\\nobject of his visit, recognising the necessity of explanation, and ready\\nto give all that was in her power.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo; papa does not know,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, â\\x80\\x9cbut it is because he has taken no\\ncharge of me--he has left me to myself. I should not have minded so much\\nif you had been of our county, for then you would have understood; but\\nyou are a clergyman, and Mrs. ----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am a clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s wife,â\\x80\\x9d the lady said, kindly; â\\x80\\x9canything you say will\\nbe sacred to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAh,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, with a little impatient sigh; and she could not help\\nlooking at the door, and longing for Colin, who was coming no more,\\nthough she did not know that; for the girl, though she was not clever,\\nhad a perception within her, such as never would have come to Colin,\\nthat, notwithstanding this solemn assurance, the fact that her visitor\\nwas a clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s wife would not prevent her story from oozing out into\\nthe common current of English talk in Rome;--but, notwithstanding,\\nAlice, whose ideas of her duty to the world were very clear, knew that\\nthe story must be told. She went on accordingly very steadily, though\\nwith thrills and flushes of colour coming and going--and the chances are\\nthat Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ideal woman, could she have been placed in the same\\nposition, would not have acquitted herself half so well.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will be necessary to tell you everything from the beginning, or you\\nwill not understand it,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice. â\\x80\\x9cPapa did not do exactly as Arthur\\nthought right in some things; and though I did not think myself a judge,\\nI--I took Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s side; and then Mrs. Meredith came to Maltby suddenly\\nwith the children. It was a great surprise to us, for we did not know\\ntill that moment that papa had married again. I would rather not say\\nanything about Mrs. Meredith,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, showing a little agitation,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut Arthur did not think she was a person whom I could stay with; and,\\nwhen he had to leave himself he brought me with him. Indeed, I wanted\\nvery much to come. I could not bear that he should go away by himself;\\nand I should have died had I been left there with papa, and everything\\nso changed. I wrote after we left, but papa would not answer my letter,\\nnor take any notice of us. I am very sorry, but I cannot help it. That\\nis all. I suppose you heard of Mrs. Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s letter to Mr. Lauderdale.\\nMy aunt is in India--so I could not go to her; and all the rest are\\ndead; that is why I have stayed here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is very sad to think you should be so lonely,â\\x80\\x9d said the clergyman,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand it is a very trying position for one so young. Still there are\\nfamilies in Rome that would have received you; and I think, my dear Miss\\nMeredith--you must not suppose me harsh--it is only your good I am\\nthinking of; I think you should yourself have communicated with your\\nfather.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wrote to Aunt Mary,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice. â\\x80\\x9cI told her everything. I thought\\nshe would be sure to advise me for the best. But papa would not answer\\nthe letter I wrote him after we left home, and he refuses to have\\nanything to do with me in Mr. Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s letter. I do not understand\\nwhat I can do more.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut you have not waited to be advised,â\\x80\\x9d said the English priest, whose\\nwife had taken the poor little culpritâ\\x80\\x99s hand, and was whispering to\\nher, â\\x80\\x9cCompose yourself, my dear,â\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cWe are your friends,â\\x80\\x9d and\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. ---- only means it for your good,â\\x80\\x9d with other such scraps of\\nconsolation. Alice scarcely needed the first exhortation, having, in a\\nlarge degree, that steady power of self-control which is one of the most\\nvaluable endowments in the world. â\\x80\\x9cYou have not waited for your Auntâ\\x80\\x99s\\nadvice,â\\x80\\x9d continued the clergyman. â\\x80\\x9cIndeed, I confess it is very hard to\\nblame you; but still it is a very serious step to take, and one that a\\nyoung creature like you should not venture upon without the advice of\\nher friends. Mr. Campbell also is very young, and you cannot have known\\neach other very long.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAll the winter,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, with a faint colour, for affairs were too\\nserious for ordinary blushing; â\\x80\\x9cat least all the spring, ever since we\\nleft England. And it has not been common knowing,â\\x80\\x9d she added, with a\\ndeepening flush. â\\x80\\x9cHe and Mr. Lauderdale were like brothers to\\nArthur--they nursed him night and day; they nursed him better than I\\ndid,â\\x80\\x9d said the poor sister, bursting forth into natural tears. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\npeople we have known all our lives were never so good to us. He said at\\nthe very last that they were to take care of me; and they have taken\\ncare of me,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, among her sobs, raised for a moment beyond\\nherself by her sense of the chivalrous guardianship which had surrounded\\nher, â\\x80\\x9cas if I had been a queen.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear child, lean upon me,â\\x80\\x9d said the lady sitting by; â\\x80\\x9cdonâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nafraid of us; donâ\\x80\\x99t mind crying, it will be a relief to you. Mr. ----\\nonly means it for your good; he does not intend to vex you, dear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cCertainly not, certainly not,â\\x80\\x9d said the clergyman, taking a little walk\\nto the window, as men do in perplexity; and then he came back and drew\\nhis seat closer, as Alice regained the mastery over herself. â\\x80\\x9cMy dear\\nyoung lady, have confidence in me. Am I to understand that it is from\\ngratitude you have made up your mind to accept Mr. Campbell? Donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhesitate. I beg of you to let me know the truth.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe downcast face of Alice grew crimson suddenly to the hair; and then\\nshe lifted her eyes, not to the man who was questioning her, but to the\\nwoman who sat beside her. Those eyes were full of indignant complaint\\nand appeal. â\\x80\\x9cCan you, a woman, stand by and see the heart of another\\nwoman searched for its secret?â\\x80\\x9d That was the utterance of Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s look;\\nand she made no further answer, but turned her head partly away, with an\\noffended pride which sat strangely and yet not unbecomingly upon her.\\nThe change was so marked that the reverend questioner got up from his\\nchair again almost as confused as Alice, and his wife, instinctively\\nreplying to the appeal made to her, took the matter into her own hands.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you will wait for me below, George, I will join you by-and-by,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthis good woman. â\\x80\\x9cMen must not spy into womenâ\\x80\\x99s secrets.â\\x80\\x9d And â\\x80\\x9cI have\\ndaughters of my own,â\\x80\\x9d she added softly in Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s ear. Let us thank\\nheaven, that, though the number of those be few who are able or disposed\\nto do great things for their fellows, the number is many who are ready\\nto respond to an actual call for sympathy when it is made to them, and\\nto own the universal kindred. It was not an everlasting friendship that\\nthese two English women, left alone in the bare Italian chamber, formed\\nfor each other. The one who was a mother did not receive the orphan\\npermanently into her breast, neither did the girl find a parent in her\\nnew friend. Yet for the moment nature found relief for itself; they were\\nmother and child, though strangers to each other. The elder woman heard\\nwith tears, and sympathy, and comprehension, the otherâ\\x80\\x99s interrupted\\ntale, and gave her the kiss which in its way was more precious than a\\nloverâ\\x80\\x99s. â\\x80\\x9cYou have done nothing wrong, my poor child,â\\x80\\x9d the pitying woman\\nsaid, affording an absolution more valuable than any priestâ\\x80\\x99s to the\\ngirlâ\\x80\\x99s female soul; and as she spoke there passed momentarily through\\nthe mind of the visitor a rapid, troubled enumeration of the rooms in\\nher â\\x80\\x9capartment,â\\x80\\x9d which involved the possibility of carrying this\\nfriendless creature home with her. But that idea was found impracticable\\nalmost as soon as conceived. â\\x80\\x9cI wish I could take you home with me, my\\ndear,â\\x80\\x9d the good woman said, with a sigh; â\\x80\\x9cbut our rooms are so small;\\nbut I will talk it all over with Mr. ----, and see what can be done; and\\nI should like to know more of Mr. Campbell after all you tell me; he\\nmust be a very superior young man. You may be sure we shall be your\\nfriends, _both your friends_, whatever happens. I should just like to\\nsay a word to the woman of the house, and tell her to take good care of\\nyou, my dear, before I go.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSora Antonia is very kind,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, my dear, I am sure of it; still she will be all the more attentive\\nwhen she sees you have friends to take care of you,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nexperienced woman; which was all the more kind on her part as her\\nItalian was very limited, and a personal encounter of this description\\nwas one which she would have shrunk from in ordinary circumstances. But\\nwhen she joined her husband it was with a glow of warmth and kindness\\nabout her heart, and a consciousness of having comforted the friendless.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf it ever could be right to do such a thing, I almost think it would\\nbe in such a case as this,â\\x80\\x9d she said with a womanâ\\x80\\x99s natural leaning to\\nthe romantic side; but the clergyman only shook his head. â\\x80\\x9cWe must wait,\\nat all events, for an answer from Mr. Meredith,â\\x80\\x9d he said; and the\\nfortnight which ensued was not a cheerful one for Alice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\\n\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that the clergyman was right in suggesting that\\nColin should leave Frascati, and that the strange little household which\\nhad kept together since Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s death, under the supervision of Sora\\nAntonia, was in its innocence in utter contradiction of all decorum and\\nthe usages of society. It was true besides that Alice had begun to be\\nuneasy upon this very point, and to feel herself in a false position;\\nnevertheless, when Lauderdale returned alone with a note from Colin, and\\ninformed her that they had found rooms in Rome, and were to leave her\\nwith Sora Antonia until the arrangements were made for the marriage, it\\nis inconceivable how blank and flat the evening felt to Alice without\\nher two knights. As she sat over her needlework her sorrow came more\\nfrequently home to her than it had ever done before--her sorrow, her\\nfriendlessness, and a vague dread that this great happiness, which had\\ncome in tears, and which even now could scarcely be separated from the\\ngrief which accompanied it, might again fly away from her like a passing\\nangel. Sora Antonia was indifferent company under these circumstances;\\nshe was very kind, but it was not in nature that an elderly peasant\\nwoman could watch the changing expressions of a girlâ\\x80\\x99s face, and\\nforestall her tears, and beguile her weariness like the two chivalrous\\nmen who had devoted themselves to her amusement and occupation. Now that\\nthis rare morsel of time, during which she had been tended â\\x80\\x9clike a\\nqueen,â\\x80\\x9d was over, it seemed impossible to Alice that it ever could be\\nagain. She who was not clever, who was nothing but Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s sister, how\\ncould she ever expect again to be watched over and served like an\\nenchanted princess? Though, indeed, if she were Colinâ\\x80\\x99s wife--! but\\nsince Colinâ\\x80\\x99s departure and the visit of the clergyman, that possibility\\nseemed to grow dimmer and dimmer--she could not tell why. She believed\\nin it when her lover came to see her, which was often enough; but, when\\nhe was absent, doubt returned, and the bright prospect glided away,\\ngrowing more and more dim and distant. She had never indulged in\\nimagination, to speak of, before, and the few dreams that had possessed\\nher heart had been dreams of Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s recovery--fantastic hopeless\\nvisions of those wondrous doctors and impossible medicines sometimes to\\nbe met with in books. But now, when her own position began to occupy\\nher, and she found herself standing between hopes and fears, with such\\na sweet world of tenderness and consolation on one side, and so unlovely\\na prospect on the other, the dormant imagination woke up, and made wild\\nwork with Alice. Even in the face of her stepmotherâ\\x80\\x99s refusal to have\\nanything to do with her, the spectre of Mrs. Meredith coming to take her\\nhome was the nightmare of the poor girlâ\\x80\\x99s existence. This was what she\\ngained by the clergymanâ\\x80\\x99s attention to the proprieties of the situation;\\nbut there was at least the comfort of thinking that in respect to\\ndecorum all was now perfectly right.\\n\\nAs for Colin, he, it must be confessed, bore the separation better; for\\nhe was not at all afraid of Mrs. Meredith, and he had a great many\\nthings to learn and do, and, when he paid his betrothed a visit, it was\\nsweet to see the flush of unmistakeable joy in her face, and to feel\\nthat so fair a creature sat thinking of him in the silence, referring\\neverything to him, ready to crown him with all the hopes and blossoms of\\nher youth. And then, but for her sake, Colin, to tell the truth, was in\\nno such hurry to be married as his clerical censor supposed. The weeks\\nthat might have to elapse before that event could be concluded were not\\nnearly so irksome to him as they ought to have been; and, even though he\\nbegan to be irritated by the ambiguous responses of the clergyman, he\\nwas not impatient of the delay itself, but found the days very\\ninteresting, and, on the whole, enjoyed himself; which, to be sure, may\\ngive some people an unfavourable impression of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart, and want\\nof sympathy with the emotions of her he looked upon as his bride. At the\\nsame time, it is but just to say that he was not aware of these\\nemotions--for Alice said nothing about her fears; and his love for her,\\nwhich was genuine enough in its way, was not of the nature of that love\\nwhich divines everything, and reads the eye and the heart with\\ninfallible perception. He did not suffer, like Alice, from fears that\\nhis dawning happiness was too great, and could never come true; for,\\nthough he had fully accepted his position, and even with the facility of\\nyouth had found pleasure in it, and found himself growing fonder every\\nday of the sweet and tranquil creature to whom he became day by day more\\ncompletely all in all, this kind of calm domestic love was\\nunimpassioned, and not subject to the hopes and fears, the despairs and\\nexultations of more spontaneous and enthusiastic devotion. So, to tell\\nthe truth, he endured the separation with philosophy, and roamed about\\nall day long with many a thought in his mind, through that town which is\\nof all towns in the world most full of memories, most exciting and most\\nsorrowful. Colin, being Scotch, was not classical to speak of, and the\\nCÃ¦sars had but a limited interest for him; but, if the ancient tutelary\\ndeities were worn out and faded, the shrine to which pilgrims had come\\nfor so many ages was musical with all the echoes of history, and\\naffecting beyond description or comparison. And in Papal Rome the young\\npriest had an interest altogether different from that of a polemical\\nProtestant or a reverential High-Churchman. Colin was a man of his age,\\ntolerant and indulgent to other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s opinions, and apt to follow out\\nhis own special study without pausing to consider whether the people\\namong whom he pursued it were without spot or blemish in matters of\\ndoctrine. The two friends spent a great deal of time in the churches;\\nnot at the high mass, or sweet-voiced vespers, where irreverent crowds\\nassembled, as in a concert-room, to hear Mustafa sing, but in\\nout-of-the-way chapels, where there were no signs of _festa_; in the\\nPantheon, in churches where there were no great pictures nor celebrated\\nimages, but where the common people went and came unconscious of any\\nspectators; and many and strange were the discussions held by the two\\nScotchmen over the devotions they witnessed--devotions ignorant enough,\\nno doubt, but real, and full of personal meaning. It was Rome without\\nher glorious apparel, without her grandeur and melodies,--Rome in very\\npoor vestments, not always clean, singing out of tune, and regarding\\nwith eyes of intensest supplication such poor daubs of saints and\\nweak-eyed Madonnas as would have found no place in the meanest\\nexhibition anywhere in the world. Strangely enough, this was the aspect\\nin which she had most interest for the two friends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt would be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 curious to hear the real thoughts these honest folk\\nhave in their minds,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no much of the idolatry way\\nof thinking myselâ\\x80\\x99. It may come a wee that way in respect to Mary. The\\nrest of them are little more than friends at court so far as I can see,\\nand itâ\\x80\\x99s no unnatural feeling. If you take the view that aâ\\x80\\x99 natural\\nfeelings are like to be wrong to start with, that settles the question;\\nbut if, on the other hand--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in idolatry under any circumstances,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nhotly; â\\x80\\x9cnobody worships a bad picture. It is the something represented\\nby it, never to be fully expressed, and of which, indeed, a bad picture\\nis almost more touching than a good one--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cKeep quiet, callant, and let other folk have a chance to speak,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m saying thereâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal of reasonableness in\\nnature if you take her in the right way. Iâ\\x80\\x99m far from being above that\\nfeeling myselâ\\x80\\x99. No that I have ony acquaintance with St. Cosmo and St.\\nDamian and the rest; but I wouldna say if there was ony rational way of\\ngetting at the ear of one of them thatâ\\x80\\x99s gone--even if it was Arthur,\\npoor callant--that I wouldna be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 tempted to bid him mind upon me\\nwhen he was near the Presence Chaâ\\x80\\x99amer. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying he had much wisdom\\nto speak of, or was more enlightened than myself; and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no\\ndistinct evidence that at this moment heâ\\x80\\x99s nearer God than I am; but I\\ntell you, callant, natureâ\\x80\\x99s strong--and, if I kent ony way of\\ncommunication, thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae philosophy in the world would keep me from\\nasking, if he was nigh the palace gates and could see Him that sits upon\\nthe throne, that he should mind upon me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may be sure he does it without asking,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin--and then, after\\na momentâ\\x80\\x99s pause, â\\x80\\x9cYour illustration comes too close for criticism. I\\nknow what you mean; but then the saints as they flourish in Rome have\\nnothing to do with Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be something\\nto get the people to have a little respect for the saints; but, as to\\nsaying their prayers to them, there is little danger of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe callantâ\\x80\\x99s crazy about Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9ca man that heard\\nyou and kent no better might think ye were the king of Scotland in\\ndisguise, with a scheme of Church reform in your hand. If youâ\\x80\\x99re ever a\\nminister youâ\\x80\\x99ll be in hot water before youâ\\x80\\x99re well placed. But, Colin,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 descent from all your grand thoughts. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to fight\\nwith the presbytery about organs and such like rubbish--and when youâ\\x80\\x99re\\nto stand, and when youâ\\x80\\x99re to sit; thatâ\\x80\\x99s what ambitious callants come to\\nin our kirk. You were like enough for such a fate at any time, but\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re certain of it now with your English wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cit is no worse than the fight about candles and\\nsurplices in England; better, indeed, for it means something; and, if I\\nfight on that point, at least Iâ\\x80\\x99ll fight at the same time for better\\nthings.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s aye best no to fight at all,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, â\\x80\\x9cthough thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nno a doctrine palatable to human nature so far as I have ever seen. But\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy talking; youâ\\x80\\x99re no ready for your profession yet;\\nand how you are ever to be ready, and you a married man----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cmost men are married; but I donâ\\x80\\x99t see that _that_\\nfact hinders the business of the world. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to spend all my\\ntime with my wife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale with a momentary touch of deeper seriousness--and\\nhe paused and cast a side glance at his companion as if longing to say\\nsomething; but it happened at that moment, either by chance or\\nintention, that Colin turned the full glow of his brown eyes upon his\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s face, looking at him with that bright but blank smile which he\\nhad seen before, and which imposed silence more absolutely than any\\nprohibition. â\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, slowly changing his tone; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\nsay it was that I was thinking of. The generality of callants studying\\nfor the kirk in our country are no in your position. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no clear in my\\nown mind how itâ\\x80\\x99s come to pass--for a young man thatâ\\x80\\x99s the head of a\\nfamily has a different class of subjects to occupy his mind; and as for\\nthe Balliol scholarshipâ\\x80\\x9d--said the philosopher regretfully; â\\x80\\x9cbut thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nno what Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to provide for your own house, callant,\\nbefore you think of the kirk.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I have thought of all that,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI think Alice will get\\non with my mother. She must stay there, you know, and I will go down as\\noften as I can during the winter. What do you mean by making no answer?\\nDo you think she will not like Ramore? My mother is fit company for a\\nqueen,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man with momentary irritation; for, indeed, he\\nwas a little doubtful in his own mind how this plan would work.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve little acquaintance with queens,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nthinking history would tell different tales if the half of them were fit\\nto be let within the door where the Mistress was. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s no the\\nquestion. Itâ\\x80\\x99s clear to me that your wife will rather have your company\\nthan your motherâ\\x80\\x99s--which is according to nature, though you and me may\\nbe of a different opinion. If you listen to me, Colin, youâ\\x80\\x99ll think aâ\\x80\\x99\\nthat over again. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 serious question. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying a word\\nagainst the kirk; whatever fools may say, itâ\\x80\\x99s a grand profession;\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s nae profession so grand that I ken of; but a man shouldna begin\\na race with burdens on his back and chains on his limbs. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to\\nmake your choice between love and it, Colin; and since in the first\\nplace youâ\\x80\\x99ve made choice of love----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; but it was not said with his usual lightness of\\ntone, and he turned upon his friend with a subdued exasperation which\\nmeant more than it expressed. â\\x80\\x9cWhy do you speak to me of love and----\\nnonsense,â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, â\\x80\\x9cwhat choice is there?â\\x80\\x9d and then he recollected\\nhimself, and grew red and angry. â\\x80\\x9cMy love has Providence itself for a\\nsecond,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cif it were mere fancy you might speak; but, as for\\ngiving up my profession, nothing shall induce me to do that. Alice is\\nnot like a fanciful fool to hamper and constrain me. She will stay with\\nmy mother. Two years more will complete my studies, and then----â\\x80\\x9d here\\nColin paused of himself, and did not well know what to add; for, indeed,\\nit was then chiefly that the uttermost uncertainty commenced.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd then--â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, meditatively. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 serious\\nquestion. Itâ\\x80\\x99s ill to say what may happen then. What Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying is no\\npleasure to me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve put mair hope on your head than any manâ\\x80\\x99s justified\\nin putting on another man. Ye were the ransom of my soul, callant,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nthe philosopher, with momentary emotion. â\\x80\\x9cIt was you that was to _be_;\\nnothing but talk will ever come out of a man like me--and itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nconsolation to contemplate a soul that means to live. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s more\\nways of living--ay, and of serving God and Scotland--than in the kirk.\\nNo man in the world can fight altogether in the face of circumstance. I\\nwould think it aâ\\x80\\x99 well over again, if I were you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo more,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with all the more impatience that he felt the\\ntruth of what his friend was saying. â\\x80\\x9cNo more; I am not to be moved on\\nthat subject. No, no, it is too much; I cannot give up my profession,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe said, half under his breath, to himself; and, perhaps, at the bottom\\nof his soul, a momentary grudge, a momentary pang, arose within him at\\nthought of the woman who could accept such a sacrifice without even\\nknowing it, or feeling how great it was. Such, alas, was not the woman\\nof Colinâ\\x80\\x99s dreams; yet so inconsistent was the young man in his youth,\\nthat ten minutes after, when the two walked past the Colosseum on their\\nway to the railway, being bound to Frascati (for this was before the\\ndays when the vulgar highway of commerce had entered within the walls of\\nRome), a certain wavering smile on his lip, a certain colour on his\\ncheeks, betrayed as plainly that he was bound on a loverâ\\x80\\x99s errand, as if\\nit had been said in words. Lauderdale, whose youthful days were past,\\nand who was at all times more a man of one idea, more absolute and fixed\\nin his affections, than Colin, could understand him less on this point\\nthan on any other; but he saw how it was, though he did not attempt to\\nexplain how it could be, and the two friends grew silent, one of them\\ndelivered by sheer force of youthfulness and natural vigour from the\\nanxieties that clouded the other. As they approached the gate, a\\ncarriage, which had been stopped there by the watchful ministers of the\\nDogana, made a sudden start, and dashed past them. It was gone in a\\nmoment, flashing on in the sunshine at the utmost speed which a reckless\\nItalian coachman could get out of horses which did not belong to him;\\nbut in that instant, both the bystanders started, and came to a sudden\\npause in their walk. â\\x80\\x9cDid you hear anything?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was it?â\\x80\\x9d\\nand the young man turned round, and made a few rapid strides after the\\ncarriage; but then Colin stopped short, with an uneasy laugh at himself.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAbsurd,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9call English voices sound something alike,â\\x80\\x9d which was\\nan unlover-like remark. And then he turned to his friend, who looked\\nalmost as much excited as himself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose thatâ\\x80\\x99s it,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, but he was less easily satisfied\\nthan Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot see how it could be her,â\\x80\\x9d he said, slowly;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut----. Yonâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 speed if thereâ\\x80\\x99s no reason for it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m terrible\\ntempted to jump into that machine there, and follow,â\\x80\\x9d the philosopher\\nadded, with a stride towards a crazy little one-horse carriage which was\\nwaiting empty at the gate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is I who should do that,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and then he laughed, shaking\\noff his fears. â\\x80\\x9cIt is altogether impossible and absurd,â\\x80\\x9d the young man\\nsaid. â\\x80\\x9cNonsense! there are scores of English girls who have voices\\nsufficiently like herâ\\x80\\x99s to startle one. I have thought it was she\\nhalf-a-dozen times since I came to Rome. Come along, or we shall lose\\nthe train. Nothing could possibly bring her into Rome without our\\nknowledge; and nothing, I hope,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lover, who was in little\\ndoubt on that branch of the subject, â\\x80\\x9ccould make her pass by _me_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cExcept her father,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, to which Colin only replied by an\\nimpatient exclamation as they went on to the train. But, though it was\\nonly a momentary sound, the tone of a voice, that had startled them, it\\nwas with extreme impatience and an uneasiness which they had tried to\\nhide from each other that they made their way to Frascati. To be sure\\nColin amused himself for a little by the thought of a pretty speech with\\nwhich he could flatter and flutter his gentle _fiancÃ©e_, telling her her\\nvoice was in the air, and he heard it everywhere; and then he burst\\nforth into â\\x80\\x9cAiry tongues that syllable menâ\\x80\\x99s names,â\\x80\\x9d to the\\nconsternation of Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cBut then she did not syllable any name,â\\x80\\x9d\\nhe added, laughing; â\\x80\\x9cwhich is a proof positive that it can have been\\nnothing.â\\x80\\x9d His laugh and voice were, however, full of excitement and\\nuneasiness, and betrayed to Lauderdale that the suggestion he had made\\nbegan to work. The two mounted the hill to Frascati from the station\\nwith a swiftness and silence natural to two Scotchmen at such a moment,\\nleaving everything in the shape of carriage behind them. When they\\nreached the Palazzo Savvelli, Colin cleared the long staircase at a\\nbound for anything his companion saw who followed him more slowly, more\\nand more certainly prescient of something having happened. When\\nLauderdale reached the _salone_, he found nobody there save Sora\\nAntonia, with her apron at her eyes, and Colin, sunk into Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s\\nchair, reading a letter which he held in both his hands. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face\\nwas crimson, his hands trembling with excitement and passion. The next\\nmoment he had started to his feet and was ready for action. â\\x80\\x9cRead it,\\nLauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a choking voice; â\\x80\\x9cyou may read it; it has all\\ncome true; and in the meantime Iâ\\x80\\x99m off to get a vettura,â\\x80\\x9d said the young\\nman, rushing to the door. Before his friend could say a word, Colin was\\ngone, tearing frantically down the stairs which he had come up like\\nlightning; and in this bewildering moment, after the thunderbolt had\\nfallen, with Sora Antoniaâ\\x80\\x99s voice ringing in his ear as loudly and\\nscarce more intelligibly than the rain which accompanies a storm,\\nLauderdale picked up poor Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s letter, which was blotted with tears.\\n\\n     â\\x80\\x9cPapa has come to fetch me,â\\x80\\x9d wrote Alice. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Colin, my heart is\\n     broken! He says we are to go instantly, without a momentâ\\x80\\x99s delay;\\n     and he would not let me write even this if he knew. Oh, Colin,\\n     after all your goodness and kindness, and love that I was not\\n     worthy of!--oh, why did anybody ever interfere? I do not know what\\n     I am writing, and I am sure you will never be able to read it.\\n     Never so long as I live shall I think one thought of anybody but\\n     you; but papa would not let me speak to you--would not wait to see\\n     you, though I told him you were coming. Oh Colin, good-bye, and do\\n     not think it is me--and tell Mr. Lauderdale I shall never forget\\n     his kindness. I would rather, far rather, die than go away. Always,\\n     always, whatever any one may say, your own poor Alice, who is not\\n     half nor quarter good enough for you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuch was the hurried utterance of her disappointment and despair which\\nAlice had left behind her ere she was forced away; but Sora Antonia held\\nanother document of a more formal description, which she delivered to\\nLauderdale with a long preface, of which he did not understand a word.\\nHe opened it carelessly; for, the fact being apparent, Lauderdale, who\\nhad no hand in the business on his own account, was sufficiently\\nindifferent to any compliments which the father of Alice might have to\\npay to himself.\\n\\n     â\\x80\\x9cMr. Meredith regrets to have the sentiments of gratitude with\\n     which he was prepared to meet Mr. Lauderdale, on account of\\n     services rendered to his son, turned into contempt and indignation\\n     by the base attempt on the part of Mr. Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s companion to\\n     ensnare the affections of his daughter. Having no doubt whatever\\n     that when removed from the personal coercion in which she has been\\n     held, Miss Meredith will see the base character of the connexion\\n     which it has been attempted to force upon her, Mr. Meredith will,\\n     in consideration of the services above mentioned, take no legal\\n     steps for the exposure of the conspiracy which he has fortunately\\n     found out in time to defeat its nefarious object; but begs that it\\n     may be fully understood that his leniency is only to be purchased\\n     by an utter abstinence from any attempt to disturb Miss Meredith,\\n     or bring forward the ridiculous pretensions of which she is too\\n     young to see the utterly interested and mercenary character.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA man does not generally preserve his composure unabated after reading\\nsuch an epistle, and Lauderdale was no more capable than other men of\\ndissembling his indignation. His face flushed with a dark glow, more\\nburning and violent than anything that had disturbed his blood for\\nyears; and it was as well for the character of the grave and\\nsober-minded Scotsman that nobody but Sora Antonia was present to listen\\nto the first exclamation that rose to his lips. Sora Antonia herself was\\nin a state of natural excitement, pouring forth her account of all that\\nhad happened with tears and maledictions, which were only stopped by\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s shout from the foot of the staircase for his friend. The\\nimpatient youth came rushing upstairs when he found no immediate\\nresponse, and swept the older man with him like a whirlwind. â\\x80\\x9cAnother\\ntime, another time,â\\x80\\x9d he cried to Sora Antonia, â\\x80\\x9cI must go first and\\nbring the Signorina back,â\\x80\\x9d and Colin picked up both the letters, and\\nrushed down, driving Lauderdale before him to the carriage which he had\\nalready brought to the door; and they were driving off again, whirling\\ndown hill towards the Campagna, before either had recovered the first\\nshock of this unlooked-for change in all their plans. Then it was\\nLauderdale who was the first to speak.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going to bring the Signorina back,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a long breath.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a foolâ\\x80\\x99s errand, but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no say but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go with you. Colin,\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s happened as was only natural. The father has got better, as I said\\nhe would. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no blaming the fatherâ\\x80\\x9d--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNot after _this_?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who had just read in a blaze of\\nindignation Mr. Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s letter.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHout,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, â\\x80\\x9ccertainly not after that;â\\x80\\x9d and he took it\\nout of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s hand and folded it up and tore it into a dozen pieces.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe man kens nothing of me. Callant,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, warming\\nsuddenly, â\\x80\\x9cthere is but one person to be considered in this business.\\nYou and me can fend for ourselves. Pain and sorrow cannot but come on\\nher as things are, but nothing is to be done or said that can aggravate\\nthem, or give her more to bear. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no heeding what I say. Where are\\nyou going now, if a man might ask?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am going to claim my bride,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, shortly. â\\x80\\x9cDo you imagine I\\nam likely to abandon her now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cColin,â\\x80\\x9d said his friend anxiously, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ll no get her. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nforbidding you to try, but I warn you not to hope. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s in the hands of\\nher natural guardian, and at this moment thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae power on earth that\\nwould induce him to give her to you. Heâ\\x80\\x99s to be blamed for ill speaking,\\nbut Iâ\\x80\\x99m no clear that heâ\\x80\\x99s to be blamed for this.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI wish you would not talk,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin roughly, and opened Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlittle letter again, and read it and put it to his lips. If he had never\\nbeen impassioned before he was so now; and so they went on, dashing\\nacross the long level Campagna roads, where there was nothing to break\\nthe sunshine but here and there a nameless pile of ruins.\\n\\nThe sunshine began to fall low and level on the plain before they\\nreached the gates. â\\x80\\x9cOne thing at least is certain--he cannot take her\\nout of Rome to-night,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. It was almost the only word that was\\nspoken between them until they began their doubtful progress from one\\nhotel to another, through the noisy resounding streets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNow we have found them let me face them by myself,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, to whom\\nthe interval of silence and consideration had been of use. They were\\nboth waiting in the hall of one of the hotels facing towards the Piazza\\ndel Popolo, to which they had at last tracked Mr. Meredith, and\\nLauderdale acquiesced silently in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s decision. The young man had\\nalready sent up his card, with a request that he might see not Alice but\\nher father. After a considerable time, the servant who had taken it\\nreturned with an abrupt message that Mr. Meredith was engaged. When he\\nhad sent up a second time, explaining that his business was urgent, but\\nwith the same effect, Colin accompanied his third message with a note,\\nand went with his messenger to the door of the room in which his\\nadversary was. There could be no doubt of the commotion produced within\\nby this third application. Colin could hear some one pacing about the\\nroom with disturbed steps, and the sound of a controversy going on,\\nwhich, though he was too far off to hear anything that was said, still\\nreached him vaguely in sound at least. When he had waited for about five\\nminutes, the clergyman, whom he had not in the least thought of or\\nexpected to see, made his appearance cautiously at the door. He did not\\nattempt to admit the young man, but came up to him on tiptoe, and took\\nhim persuasively, almost caressingly, by the arm. â\\x80\\x9cMy good friend, my\\nexcellent young friend,â\\x80\\x9d said the puzzled priest, with a mixture of\\ncompunction and expostulation which in other circumstances would have\\namused Colin, â\\x80\\x9clet us have a little conversation. I am sure you are much\\ntoo generous and considerate to add to the distress of--of----â\\x80\\x9d But here\\nthe good man recollected just in time that he had pledged himself not to\\nspeak of Alice, and made a sudden pause. â\\x80\\x9cThere in that room,â\\x80\\x9d he went\\non, changing his tone, and assuming a little solemnity, â\\x80\\x9cis a sorrowful\\nfather, mourning for his only son, and driven almost out of his senses\\nby illness and weakness, and a sense of the shameful way in which his\\ndaughter has been neglected--not his fault, my dear Mr Campbell. You\\ncannot have the heart to increase his sufferings by claims, however well\\nfounded, which have been formed at a time----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStop,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cit is not my fault if he has not done his duty to\\nhis children; I have no right to bear the penalty. He has cast the\\nvilest imputations upon me--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush, hush, I beg of you,â\\x80\\x9d said the clergyman, â\\x80\\x9cmy excellent young\\nfriend--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin laughed in spite of himself. â\\x80\\x9cIf I am your excellent friend,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cwhy do you not procure me admission to tell my own story? Why\\nshould the sight of me distress your sorrowing father? I am not an ogre,\\nnor an enemy, but his sonâ\\x80\\x99s friend; and up to this day, I need not\\nremind you,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man with a rising colour, â\\x80\\x9cthe only\\nprotector, along with my friend Lauderdale, whom his daughter has had. I\\ndo not say that he may not have natural objections to give her to a poor\\nman,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with natural pride; â\\x80\\x9cbut, at all events, he has no\\nreason to hurry her away by stealth, as if I had not a right to be told\\nwhy our engagement is interrupted so summarily. I will do nothing to\\ndistress Alice,â\\x80\\x9d the young man went on, involuntarily lingering by the\\ndoor, which was not entirely closed; â\\x80\\x9cbut I protest against being\\ntreated like a villain or an adventurer--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush, hush, hush,â\\x80\\x9d cried the unlucky peacemaker, putting out his hand\\nto close the unfastened door; and before he could do so, Mr. Meredith\\nappeared on the threshold, flushed and furious. â\\x80\\x9cWhat are you else, sir,\\nI should like to know,â\\x80\\x9d cried the angry British father, â\\x80\\x9cto drag an\\nunprotected girl into such an entanglement without even a pretence of\\nconsulting her friends; to take advantage of a deathbed for your\\ndetestable fortune-hunting schemes? Donâ\\x80\\x99t answer me, sir! Have you a\\npenny of your own? have you anything to live on? Thatâ\\x80\\x99s the question. If\\nit was not for other considerations, Iâ\\x80\\x99d indict you. Iâ\\x80\\x99d charge you with\\nconspiracy; and even now, if you come here to disturb my poor girl----.\\nBut I promise you, you shall see her no more,â\\x80\\x9d the angry man continued.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGo, sir, and let me hear no more of you. She has a protector now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin stood a moment without speaking after Mr. Meredith has\\ndisappeared, closing the door violently after him.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have not come to distress Alice,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man. He had to\\nrepeat it to himself to keep down the hot blood that was burning in his\\nveins; and as for the unfortunate clergyman, who was the immediate cause\\nof all this, he kept his position by the door in a state of mind far\\nfrom enviable, sorry for the young man, and ashamed of the old one, and\\nmaking inarticulate efforts to speak and mediate between them. But the\\nconference did not last very long outside the closed door. Though it did\\nnot fortunately occur to Colin that it was the interference of his\\npresent companion which had originated this scene, the young man did not\\nfeel the insult the less from the deprecatory half-sympathy offered to\\nhim. â\\x80\\x9cIt is a mistake--it is a mistake,â\\x80\\x9d said the clergyman, â\\x80\\x9cMr.\\nMeredith will discover his error. I said I thought you were imprudent,\\nand indeed wrong; but I have never suspected you of interested\\nmotives--never since my first interview with the young lady;--but think\\nof her sufferings, my dear young friend; think of her,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nmediator, who was driven to his witsâ\\x80\\x99 end. As for Colin, he calmed\\nhimself down a little by means of pacing about the corridor--the common\\nresource of men in trouble.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPoor Alice,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cif I did not think of her, do you think I should\\nhave stood quietly to be insulted? But look here--the abuse of such a\\nman can do no harm to me, but he may kill her. If I could see her it\\nmight do some good.--Impossible? Do you suppose I mean to see her\\nclandestinely, or to run away with her, perhaps? I mean,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nwith youthful sternness, â\\x80\\x9cthat if I were permitted to see her I might be\\nable to reconcile her a little to what is inevitable. Of course he is\\nher father. I wish her father were a chimney-sweep instead;--but it is\\nshe I have to think of. Will you try to get me permission to see\\nher?--only for ten minutes, if you like--in your presence, if that is\\nnecessary; but I must say one word to her before she is carried away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, it is very natural--very natural,â\\x80\\x9d said the peace-maker; â\\x80\\x9cI\\nwill do all I can for you. Be here at eleven oâ\\x80\\x99clock to-morrow morning;\\nthe poor dear young lady must have rest after her agitation. Donâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nafraid; I am not a man to deceive you; they do not leave till the\\nafternoon for Civita Vecchia. You shall see her; I think I can promise\\nthat. I will take the responsibility on myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThus ended Colinâ\\x80\\x99s attempt to bring back the Signorina, as he said. In\\nthe morning he had reached the hotel long before the hour mentioned, in\\ncase of an earlier departure; but everything was quiet there, and the\\nyoung man hovered about, looking up at the windows, and wondering which\\nmight be the one which inclosed his little love, with sentiments more\\nentirely lover-like than he had ever experienced before. But, when the\\nhour of his appointment came, and he hurried into the hotel, he was met\\nby the indignant clergyman, who felt his own honour compromised, and was\\nwroth beyond measure. Mr. Meredith had left Rome at dawn of day,\\ncertainly not for Civita Vecchia, leaving no message for any one. He had\\npretended, after hot resistance, to yield to the kind-hearted priestâ\\x80\\x99s\\npetition, that the lovers might say farewell to each other, and this was\\nthe way he had taken of balking them. It was now the author of the\\noriginal mischief who felt himself insulted and scorned, and his\\nresentment and indignation were louder than Colinâ\\x80\\x99s, whose mind at first\\nlost itself in schemes of following, and vain attempts to ascertain the\\nroute the party had taken. Lauderdale, coming anxious but steady to the\\nscene of action half an hour afterwards, found his friend absorbed in\\nthis inquiry, and balancing all the chances between the road by Perugia\\nand the road by Orvieto, with the full intention of going off in\\npursuit.\\n\\nIt was then his careful guardianâ\\x80\\x99s turn to interfere. He led the youth\\naway, and pointed out to him the utter vanity of such an undertaking.\\nNot distance or uncertainty of road, but her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s will, which was\\nlikely to be made all the more rigorous by pursuit, parted Alice from\\nher young protector and bridegroom; and if he followed her to the end of\\nthe world, this obstacle would still remain as unremoveable as ever.\\nThough he was hot-headed and young, and moved by excitement, and\\nindignation, and pity, to a height of passion which his love for Alice\\nby itself would never have produced, Colin still could not help being\\nreasonable, and he saw the truth of what was said to him. At the same\\ntime, it was not natural that the shock which was so great and sudden\\nshould be got over in a moment. He felt himself insulted and outraged,\\nin the first place; and the other side of the question was almost\\nequally mortifying; for he knew the relief that would be felt by all his\\nfriends when the sudden end of his unwelcome project was made known to\\nthem. The Ramore household had given a kind of passive acquiescence in\\nwhat seemed inevitable--but Colin was aware they would all be very glad\\nat home when the failure was known--and it was a failure, howsoever the\\ntale might be told. Thus the original disappointment was aggravated by\\nstings of apprehended ridicule and jocular sympathy, for to no living\\nsoul, not even to his mother, would Colin have confessed how great a\\nshare in his original decision Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s helpless and friendless position\\nhad, nor the sense of loss and bondage with which he had often in his\\nsecret heart regarded the premature and imprudent marriage which he had\\nlived to hear stigmatised as the scheme of a fortune-hunter. It was thus\\nthat the very generosity of his intentions gave an additional sting at\\nonce to the insult and the sympathy. After a day or two, his thoughts of\\nAlice as the first person to be considered, and the deep sense of the\\nterrible calamity it was to her, yielded a little to those thoughts of\\nhimself and all the humiliating accompaniments of a change so unlooked\\nfor. During this period his temper became, even by Lauderdale,\\nunbearable; and he threw aside everything he was doing, and took to\\nsilence and solitary rambles, in utter disgust with the shortsightedness\\nand injustice of the world.\\n\\nBut after that unhappy interval it has to be confessed that the skies\\nsuddenly cleared for Colin. The first symptom of revival that happened\\nto him came to pass on a starry, lovely May night, when he had plunged\\ninto the darkness of the lonely quarter about the Colosseum alone, and\\nin a state of mind to which an encounter with the robbers supposed to\\nhaunt these silent places would have been highly beneficial. But it\\nchanced that Colin raised his moody eyes to the sky, suddenly and\\nwithout any premeditation, and saw the moon struggling up through a maze\\nof soft white clouds, parting them with her hands as they threw\\nthemselves into baffling airy masses always in her way; and suddenly,\\nwithout a moment of preface, a face--the face--the image of the veiled\\nwoman, who was not Alice, and to whom he had bidden farewell, gleamed\\nout once more through the clouds, and looked Colin in the eyes,\\nthrilling him through and through with a guilty astonishment. The moment\\nafter was the hardest of all Colinâ\\x80\\x99s struggle; and he rushed home after\\nit tingling all over with self-contempt and burning indignation, and\\nplunged into a torrent of talk when he found his friend, by way of\\nforgetting himself, which struck Lauderdale with the utmost surprise.\\nBut next day Colin felt himself somehow comforted without knowing how;\\nand then he took to thinking of his life, and work which now, even for\\nthe sake of Alice, if nothing else, he must pursue with determined\\nenergy; and then it seemed to him as if every moment was lost that kept\\nhim away from home. Was it for Alice? Was it that he might offer her\\nagain the perfected mind and settled existence to which his labours were\\nto lead him? He said so to himself as he made his plans; but yet\\nunawares a vision of deeper eyes came gleaming upon him out of the\\nclouds. And it was with the half-conscious thrill of another existence,\\na feeling as of new and sweeter air in the sails, and a widening ocean\\nunder the keel, that Colin rose up after all those varying changes of\\nsentiment were over, and set his face to the north once more.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 strange to think itâ\\x80\\x99s the last time,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, as\\nthey stood together on the Pincian Hill, and watched the glowing colours\\nof the Roman sunset. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s little likely that you and me will ever see\\nSt. Peter yonder start up black into the sun like that, another time in\\nour lives. Itâ\\x80\\x99s grander than aâ\\x80\\x99 their illuminations, though itâ\\x80\\x99s more\\nlike another kind of spirit than an angel. And this is Rome! I dinna\\nseem ever to have realized the thought before. Itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 living and\\nlife-like, callant, but itâ\\x80\\x99s the graves weâ\\x80\\x99ll mind it by. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no meaning\\nkings and CÃ¦sars. Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning them that come and never return.\\nTestaccioâ\\x80\\x99s hidden out of sight, and the cypress trees,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher; â\\x80\\x9cbut thereâ\\x80\\x99s mony an eye that will never lose sight of them\\neven at the other end of the world. I might have been going my ways with\\nan awfuâ\\x80\\x99 different heart, if it hadna been for the mercy of God.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen you thought I should die?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, to whom, in the stir of his\\nyoung life, and the words were solemn and strange to say; â\\x80\\x9cand God _is_\\nmerciful--yet Meredith is lying yonder, though not me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, and then there was a long pause. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no offering\\nony explanation,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a question between a man\\nand his Maker--spirit to spirit. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 mystery to us, but it\\nmaun be made clear and satisfying to them that go away. For me, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\npraise God,â\\x80\\x9d he said abruptly, with a harsh ring in his voice; and Colin\\nfor the first time knew assuredly that his faithful guardian had thought\\nnothing better than to bring him here to die. They went into the church\\non the hill, where the nuns were singing their sweet vespers, as they\\ndescended for the last time through the dusky avenues, listening as they\\nwent to the bells ringing the Ave Maria over all the crowded town; and\\nthere came upon Colin and his friend in different degrees that\\ncompunction of happiness which is the soul of thanksgiving. Others,--how\\nmany!--have stood speechless in dumb submission on that same spot and\\nfound no thanks to say; and it was thus that Colin, after all the events\\nthat made these four months so important in his life, entered upon a new\\nperiod of his history, and took his farewell of Rome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s hard to ken what to say,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, going to the window\\nfor the hundredth time, and looking out wistfully upon the sky which\\nshone dazzling over the Holy Loch with the excessive pathetic brightness\\nof exceptional sunshine. â\\x80\\x9cI canna make out for my part if heâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbroken-hearted or no, and a word wrong just at a moment like this would\\nbe hard on the callant. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a wonderful mercy itâ\\x80\\x99s such a bonnie day.\\nThatâ\\x80\\x99s aye a blessing both to the body and the mind.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, itâ\\x80\\x99s you that Colin takes after,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer of Ramore,\\nwith an undertone of dissatisfaction; â\\x80\\x9cso thereâ\\x80\\x99s no saying but what the\\nweather may count for something. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost understanding for my part of\\na lad that gangs abroad for his health, and gets himself engaged to be\\nmarried. In my days, when marriage came into a manâ\\x80\\x99s head, he went\\nthrough with it, and there was an end of the subject. For my part, I\\ndinna pretend to understand your newfangled ways.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, dinna be so unfeeling,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, roused to\\nremonstrance. â\\x80\\x9cYou were like to gang out of your mind about the marriage\\nwhen you thought it was to be; and now youâ\\x80\\x99re ready to sneer at the poor\\nladdie, as if he could help it. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard when his ain friends turn\\nagainst him after the ingratitude heâ\\x80\\x99s met wiâ\\x80\\x99, and the disappointment\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s had to bear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou may trust a woman for uphaudinâ\\x80\\x99 her son in such like nonsense,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid big Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThe only man oâ\\x80\\x99 sense among them that I can see was yon\\nMr. Meredith that took the lassie away. What the deevil had Colin to do\\nwith a wife, and him no a penny in his pouch? But in the meantime\\nyonderâ\\x80\\x99s the steamboat, andâ\\x80\\x99 Iâ\\x80\\x99m gaun down to meet them. If I were you I\\nwould stop still here. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no that strong,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, looking\\nupon his wife with a certain secret tenderness. â\\x80\\x9cI would stop still at\\nhame if I were you. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aye the best welcome for a callant to see his\\nmother at her ain door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWith which big Colin of Ramore strode down to the beach, where his sons\\nwere launching their own boat to meet the little steamer by which Colin\\nwas coming home. His wife looked after him with mingled feelings as he\\nwent down the brae. He had been a little hard upon Colin for these six\\nmonths past, and had directed many a covert sarcasm at the young man who\\nhad gone so far out of the ordinary course as to seek health in Italy.\\nThe farmer did not believe in any son of his needing such an expedient;\\nand, in proportion as it seemed unnecessary to his own vigorous\\nstrength, and ignorance of weakness, he took opportunity for jeers and\\njests which were to the motherâ\\x80\\x99s keen ears much less good-natured than\\nthey seemed to be. And then he had been very angry on the receipt of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s letter announcing his intended marriage, and it was with\\ndifficulty Mrs. Campbell had prevented her husband from sending in\\nreturn such an answer as might have banished Colin for ever from his\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s house. Now all these clouds had blown past, and no harm had\\ncome of them, and he was coming home as of old. His brothers were\\nlaunching the boat on the beach, and his father had gone down to meet\\nthe stranger. The Mistress stood at her door, restraining her eagerness\\nand anxiety as best she could, and obeying her husbandâ\\x80\\x99s suggestion, as\\nwomen do so often, by way of propitiating him, and bespeaking tenderness\\nand forbearance for her boy. For indeed the old times had passed away,\\nwith all their natural family gladness, and union clouded by no sense of\\ndifference. Now it was a man of independent thoughts, with projects and\\npursuits of his own differing from theirs, and with a mind no doubt\\naltered and matured by those advantages of travel which the Mistress\\nregarded in her ignorance with a certain awe, who was coming back to\\nRamore. Colin had made so many changes, while so few had occurred at\\nhome; and even a bystander, less anxious than his mother, might have had\\nreason to inquire and wonder how the matured and travelled son would\\nlook upon his unprogressive home.\\n\\nIt was now the end of September, though Colin had left Rome in May; but\\nthen his Scholarship was intended to give him the advantage of travel,\\nand specially that peculiar advantage of attendance at a German\\nUniversity which is so much prized in Scotland. He had accordingly\\npassed the intervening months in a little German town, getting up the\\nlanguage and listening to lectures made doubly misty by imperfect\\nunderstanding of the tongue. The process left Colinâ\\x80\\x99s theological ideas\\nvery much where it found them--which is to say, in a state of general\\nvagueness and uncertainty; but then he had always the advantage of being\\nable to say that he studied at Dickofptenberg. Lauderdale had left his\\nfriend, after spending, not without satisfaction, his hundred pounds,\\nand was happily re-established in the â\\x80\\x9chonourable situationâ\\x80\\x9d which he\\nhad quitted on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s account; and the young man was now returning home\\nalone, to spend a little time with his family before he returned to his\\nstudies. The Mistress watched him land from the boat, with her heart\\nbeating so loudly in her ears that no other sound was audible; and Colin\\ndid not lose much time in ascending the brae where she stood awaiting\\nhim. â\\x80\\x9cBut you should not have left your father,â\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Campbell said,\\neven in the height of her happiness. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 proud to see you home,\\nColin, my man!â\\x80\\x9d Big Colin, however, was no way displeased in his own\\nperson by his sonâ\\x80\\x99s desertion. He came up leisurely after him, not\\nwithout a thrill of conscious satisfaction. The farmer was sufficiently\\ndisposed to scoff aloud at his sonâ\\x80\\x99s improved looks, at his beard, and\\nhis dress, and all the little particulars which made a visible\\ndifference between the present Colin and the awkward country lad of two\\nyears ago; but in his heart he made involuntary comparisons, and\\nprivately concluded that the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s son was far from being Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nequal, and that even the heir and pride of the Duke would have little to\\nboast of in presence of the farmerâ\\x80\\x99s son of Ramore. This--though big\\nColin would not for any earthly inducement have owned the\\nsentiment--made him regard his sonâ\\x80\\x99s actions and intentions unawares\\nwith eyes more lenient and gracious. No contemptible weakness of health\\nor delicacy of appearance appeared in the sunburnt countenance, so\\nunexpectedly garnished by a light-brown, crisp, abundant beard--a beard\\nof which, to tell the truth, Colin himself was rather proud, all the\\nmore as it had by rare fortune escaped that intensification of colour\\nwhich is common to men of his complexion. The golden glitter which\\nlighted up the great waves of brown hair over his forehead had not\\ndeepened into red on his chin, as it had done in Archieâ\\x80\\x99s young but\\nvigorous whiskers. His complexion, though not so ruddy as his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s,\\nhad the tone of perfect health and vigour, untouched by any shade of\\nfatigue, or weakness. He was not going to be the â\\x80\\x9cdelicateâ\\x80\\x9d member of\\nthe family, as the farmer, with a certain contempt, had foreboded; for,\\nnaturally, to be delicate included a certain weakness of mind as well as\\nof body to the healthful dwellers in Ramore.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99ll find but little to amuse you here after aâ\\x80\\x99 your travels,â\\x80\\x9d the\\nfarmer said. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re aye busy about the beasts, Archie and me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no\\nsay itâ\\x80\\x99s an elevating study, like yours; but itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 necessary in our\\noccupation. For my part, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no above a kind oâ\\x80\\x99 pride in my cattle; and\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s your mother, sheâ\\x80\\x99s set her shoulder to the wheel and won a\\nprize.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, hastening to take up her part in the\\nconversation, â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s aye grand to be doing something. And itâ\\x80\\x99s noâ\\x80\\x99 me but\\nGowan thatâ\\x80\\x99s won the prize. She was aye a weel-conditioned creature,\\nthat it was a pleasure to have onything to do with; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty\\nof time to speak about the beasts. Youâ\\x80\\x99re sure youâ\\x80\\x99re weel and strong\\nyourself, Colin, my man? for thatâ\\x80\\x99s the first thing now weâ\\x80\\x99ve got you\\nhame.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere doesna look much amiss with him,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer, with an\\narticulate growl. â\\x80\\x9cYour motherâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 keen for somebody to pet and play\\nwiâ\\x80\\x99; but thereâ\\x80\\x99s a time for aâ\\x80\\x99 thing; and a callant, even, though heâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrought up for a minister, maun find out when heâ\\x80\\x99s a man.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI should hope there was no doubt of that,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m getting on\\nfor two-and-twenty, mother, and strong enough for anything. Thanks to\\nHarry Frankland for a splendid holiday; and now I mean to settle down to\\nwork.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHere big Colin again interjected an inarticulate exclamation. â\\x80\\x9cI ken\\nlittle about your kind of work,â\\x80\\x9d said the discontented father; â\\x80\\x9cbut, if\\nI were you, when I wanted a bit exercise I would take a hand at the\\nplough, or some wise-like occupation, instead of picking fools out of\\ncanals--or even out of lochs, for that matter,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a subdued\\nthrill of pride. â\\x80\\x9cSir Thomas is aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99 civil when he comes here; and,\\nas for that bonnie little creature thatâ\\x80\\x99s aye with him, she comes\\nchirping about the place with her fine English, as if she belonged to\\nit. I never can make out what she and your mother have such long cracks\\nabout.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMiss Frankland?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a bright look of interest. The\\nMistress had been so much startled by this unexpected speech of her\\nhusband, that she turned round upon Colin with an anxious face, eager to\\nknow what effect an intimation so sudden might have upon him. For the\\nfarmerâ\\x80\\x99s wife believed in true love and in first love with all her\\nheart, and had never been able to divest herself of the idea that it was\\npartly pique and disappointment in respect to Miss Matty which had\\ndriven her son into so hasty an engagement. â\\x80\\x9cIs she still Miss\\nFrankland?â\\x80\\x9d continued the unsuspicious Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI thought she would have\\nbeen married by this time. She is a little witch,â\\x80\\x9d the young man said\\nwith a conscious smile--â\\x80\\x9cbut I owe her a great many pleasant hours. She\\nwas always the life of Wodensbourne. Were they here this year?â\\x80\\x9d he\\nasked; and then another thought struck him. â\\x80\\x9cHollo! itâ\\x80\\x99s only\\nSeptember,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI ought to ask, Are they here now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay, Colin, theyâ\\x80\\x99re here now,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, â\\x80\\x9cand couldna be\\nmore your friends if you were one of the family. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no clear in my mind\\nthat thae two will ever be married. No that I ken of any obstacle--but,\\nso far as I can see, a bright bonny creature like that, aye full of life\\nand spirit, is nae match for the like of him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI do not see that,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man who once was Matty Franklandâ\\x80\\x99s\\nworshipper. â\\x80\\x9cShe is very bright, as you say; but he is the more honest\\nof the two. I used to be jealous of Harry Frankland,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nlaughing; â\\x80\\x9che seemed to have everything that was lacking to me; but I\\nhave changed my mind since then. One gets to believe in compensations,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the young man; and he shut his hand softly where it rested on the\\ntable, as if he felt in it the tools which a dozen Harry Franklands\\ncould have made no use of. But this thought was but dimly intelligible\\nto his hearers, to one of whom, at least, the word â\\x80\\x9cjealousâ\\x80\\x9d was limited\\nin its meaning; and, viewed in this light, the sentiment just expressed\\nby Colin was hard to understand.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no fond of what folk call compensations,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress. â\\x80\\x9cA\\nloss is aye a loss, whatever onybody can say. Siller thatâ\\x80\\x99s lost may be\\nmade up for, but naething more precious. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aye an awful marvel to me\\nthat chapter about Job getting other bairns to fill the place oâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nfirst. I would rather have the dead loss and the vacant place,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ntender woman, with tears in her eyes, â\\x80\\x9cthan aâ\\x80\\x99 your compensations. One\\ncan never stand for another--itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 infidelity to think it. If I\\ncanna have happiness, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be content with sorrow; but youâ\\x80\\x99re no to\\nspeak of compensations to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, laying his hand caressingly on his motherâ\\x80\\x99s; â\\x80\\x9cbut I\\nwas not speaking of either love or loss. I meant only that for Harry\\nFranklandâ\\x80\\x99s advantages over me, I might, perhaps, have a little balance\\non my side. For example, I picked him out of the canal, as my father\\nsays,â\\x80\\x9d the young man went on laughing; â\\x80\\x9cbut never mind the Franklands; I\\nsuppose I shall have to see them, as they are here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, Colin, you can please yourself,â\\x80\\x9d said his father. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no a man\\nto court the great, but an English baronet, like Sir Thomas, is aye a\\ncreditable acquaintance for a callant like you; and heâ\\x80\\x99s aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99 civil\\nas I was saying; but the first thing to be sure of is what you mean to\\ndo. You have had the play for near a year, and it doesna appear to me\\nthat tutorships, and that kind of thing, are the right training for a\\nminister. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll go back to your studies, and go through with them\\nwithout more interruptions, if youâ\\x80\\x99ll be guided by me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut at this point Colin paused, and had a good many explanations to\\ngive. His heart was set on the Balliol scholarship, which he had once\\ngiven up for Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s sake; and now there was another chance for him,\\nwhich had arisen unexpectedly. This it was which had hastened his return\\nhome. As for his father, the farmer yielded with but little demur to\\nthis proposal. A clear Scotch head, even when it begins to lose its\\nsense of the ideal, and to become absorbed in â\\x80\\x9cthe beasts,â\\x80\\x9d seldom\\ndeceives itself as to the benefits of education; and big Colin had an\\nintense secret confidence in the powers of his son. Honours at Oxford,\\nin the imagination of the Scotch farmer, were a visionary avenue leading\\nto any impossible altitude. He made a little resistance for appearance\\nsake, but he was in reality more excited by the idea of the\\nconflict--first, for the scholarship itself; then for all possible\\nprizes and honours to the glory of Scotland and Ramore--than was Colin\\nhimself.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut after a yearâ\\x80\\x99s play youâ\\x80\\x99re no qualified,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a sense of\\nspeaking ironically, which was very pleasant to his humour. â\\x80\\x9cA\\ncompetitionâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 business; your rivals that have aye been keeping\\nat it will be better qualified than you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which Colin smiled, as his father meant him to smile, and answered,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am not afraid,â\\x80\\x9d more modestly a great deal than the farmer in his\\nheart was answering for him; but then an unexpected antagonist arose.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna pretend to ken a great deal about Oxford,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress,\\nwhose brow was clouded; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 put-off of time as far as I\\ncan see. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no fond of spending the best of life in idle learning.\\nWeel, weel, maybe its no idle learning for them that can spare the time;\\nbut for a lad thatâ\\x80\\x99s no out of the thought of settling for himself and\\ndoing his duty to his fellow-creatures--I was reading in a book no that\\nlong ago,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother, â\\x80\\x9cabout thae fellowships and things; and\\nof men so misguided as to stay on and live to be poor bachelor bodies,\\nwith their Greek and their Latin, and no mortal use in this world. Eh,\\nColin, laddie, if that was aâ\\x80\\x99 that was to come of you!--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re keen to see your son in a pulpit, like the rest of the silly\\nwomen,â\\x80\\x9d said the farmer; â\\x80\\x9cfor my part, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no that bigoted to the kirk;\\nif he could do better for himselâ\\x80\\x99----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut at this juncture the Mistress got up with a severe countenance,\\nlaying aside the stocking she was knitting. â\\x80\\x9cOh, Colin, if you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t\\nbe so worldly!â\\x80\\x9d cried the anxious mother. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no one thatâ\\x80\\x99s aye\\nthinking of a callant bettering himself. If heâ\\x80\\x99s taken arles in one\\nservice, would you have him desert and gang over to another? I canna\\nbear for my part to see broken threads; be one thing or be another, but\\ndinna melt away and be nothing at aâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d the indignant woman concluded\\nabruptly, moving away to set things in order in the room before they all\\nretired for the night. It was the faint, far-off, and impossible idea of\\nher son settling down into one of the Fellowships of which Mrs. Campbell\\nhad been reading which moved her to this little outburst. Her authority\\nprobably was some disrespectful novel or magazine article, and this was\\nall the respect she had, in her ignorance, for the nurseries of\\nlearning.\\n\\nHer husband got up in his turn with mingled complacency and derision, as\\ncame natural to him. â\\x80\\x9cLeave the callant to himself, Jeanie. He kens\\nwhat heâ\\x80\\x99s doing; thatâ\\x80\\x99s to say, he has an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 ambition considering\\nthat heâ\\x80\\x99s only your son, and mine,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin of Ramore; and he\\nwent out to take a last look at his beasts with a thrill of secret pride\\nwhich he would not for any reward have expressed in words. He was only a\\nhumble Westland farmer looking after his beasts, and she was but his\\ntrue wife, a helpmeet no way above her natural occupations; but there\\nwas no telling what the boy might be, though he was only â\\x80\\x9cyour son and\\nmine.â\\x80\\x9d As for Colin the younger, he went up to his room half an hour\\nlater, after the family had made their homely thanksgiving for his\\nreturn, smiling in himself at the unaccountable contraction of that\\nlittle chamber, which he had once shared with Archie without finding it\\ntoo small. Many changes and many thoughts had come and gone since he\\nlast lay down under its shelving roof. Miss Matty who had danced away\\nlike a will-oâ\\x80\\x99-the-wisp, leaving no trace behind her; and Alice who had\\nwon no such devotion, yet whose soft shadow lay upon him still; and then\\nthere was the death-bed of Meredith, and his own almost death-bed at\\nWodensbourne, and all the thoughts that belonged to these. Such\\ninfluences and imaginations mature a man unawares. While he sat\\nrecalling all that had passed since he left this nest of his childhood,\\nthe Mistress tapped softly at his door, and came in upon him with\\nwistful eyes. She would have given all she had in the world for the\\npower of reading her sonâ\\x80\\x99s heart at that moment, and, indeed, there was\\nlittle in it which Colin would have objected to reveal to his mother.\\nBut the two human creatures were constrained to stand apart from each in\\nthe bonds of their individual nature--to question timidly and answer\\nvaguely, and make guesses which were all astray from the truth. The\\nMistress came behind her son and laid one hand on his shoulder, and with\\nthe other caressed and smoothed back the waves of brown hair of which\\nshe had always been so proud. â\\x80\\x9cYour hair is just as long as ever,\\nColin,â\\x80\\x9d said the admiring mother; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s no aâ\\x80\\x99 your motherâ\\x80\\x99s now,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said with a soft, little sigh. She was standing behind him that her\\neyes might not disconcert her boy, meaning to woo him into confidence\\nand the opening of his heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know who else cares for it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and then he too was\\nglad to respond to the unasked question. â\\x80\\x9cMy poor Alice,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cif I\\ncould but have brought her to you, mother--She would have been a\\ndaughter to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMrs. Campbell sighed. â\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard-hearted,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cI\\ncanna believe in ony woman ever taking _that_ place; Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 bigoted\\nto my ain. But she would have been dearly welcome for my laddieâ\\x80\\x99s sake;\\nand Iâ\\x80\\x99m real anxious to hear how it aâ\\x80\\x99 was. It was but little you said\\nin your letters; and aâ\\x80\\x99 this night Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been wanting to have you to\\nmyselâ\\x80\\x99, and to hear all that there was to say.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what there is to say,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI must have written\\nall about it. Her position, of course, made no difference to my\\nfeelings,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, rather hotly, like a man who in his own\\nconsciousness stands somewhat on his defence; â\\x80\\x9cbut it made us hasten\\nmatters. I thought if I could only have brought her home to you----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was aye you for a kind thought,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress; â\\x80\\x9cbut she would\\nhave had little need of the auld mother when she had the son; and Colin,\\nmy man, is it aâ\\x80\\x99 ended now?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeaven knows!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin with a little impatience. â\\x80\\x9cI have written to\\nher through her father, and I have written to her direct, and all that I\\nhave had from her is one little letter, saying that her father had\\nforbidden all further intercourse between us, and bidding me farewell;\\nbut----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress, â\\x80\\x9cit no of her own will; sheâ\\x80\\x99s faithful in her\\nheart? And if sheâ\\x80\\x99s true to you, youâ\\x80\\x99ll be true to her? Isna that what\\nyou mean?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI suppose so,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and then he made a little pause. â\\x80\\x9cThere\\nnever was any one so patient and so dutiful,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cWhen poor Arthur\\ndied, it was she who forgot herself to think of us. Perhaps even this is\\nnot so hard upon her as one thinks.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, but I was thinking first of my ain, like a heartless woman as I\\nam,â\\x80\\x9d said his mother. â\\x80\\x9cI was thinking it was hard on _you_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe did not turn round his face to her as she had hoped; but her keen\\neyes could see the heightened colour which tinged even his neck and his\\nforehead. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut for my part,â\\x80\\x9d he added, with a little\\neffort, â\\x80\\x9cit is chiefly Alice I have been thinking of. It may seem vain\\nto say so--but she will have less to occupy her thoughts than I shall\\nhave, and--and the time may hang heavier. You donâ\\x80\\x99t like me to go to\\nOxford, mother?â\\x80\\x9d This question was said with a little jerk, as of a man\\nwho was pleased to plunge into a new subject; and the Mistress was far\\ntoo close an observer not to understand what her son meant.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI like whatever is good for you, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cbut it was aye in\\nthe thought of losing time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no meaning real loss of time. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nmeaning I was thinking of mair hurry than there is. But youâ\\x80\\x99re both\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 young, and I like whatever is for your good, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\ntender mother. She kept folding back his heavy locks as she spoke,\\naltogether disconcerted and at a loss, poor soul; for Colinâ\\x80\\x99s calmness\\ndid not seem to his mother quite consistent with his love; and the\\npossibility of a marriage without that foundation was to Mrs. Campbell\\nthe most hideous of all suppositions. And then, like a true woman as she\\nwas, she went back to her little original romance, and grew more\\nconfused than ever.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m maybe an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 foolish woman,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with an attempt at a\\nsmile, which Colin was somehow conscious of, though he did not see it,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut, even if I am, youâ\\x80\\x99ll no be angry at your mother. Colin, my man,\\nmaybe itâ\\x80\\x99s no the best thing for you that thae folk at the castle should\\nbe here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhich folk at the castle?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who had honestly forgotten for\\nthe moment. â\\x80\\x9cOh, the Franklands! What should it matter to me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis time he turned round upon her with eyes of unabashed surprise,\\nwhich the Mistress found herself totally unprepared to meet. It was now\\nher turn to falter, and stammer, and break down.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, itâ\\x80\\x99s so hard to ken,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress. â\\x80\\x9cThe heartâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ndeceitful. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying one thing or another; for I canna read what\\nyouâ\\x80\\x99re thinking, though you are my ain laddie; but if you were to think\\nit best no to enter into temptation--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMeaning Miss Matty?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and he laughed with such entire\\nfreedom that his mother was first silenced and then offended by his\\nlevity. â\\x80\\x9cNo fear of that, mother; and then she has Harry, I suppose, to\\nkeep her right.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no so clear about that,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, nettled,\\nnotwithstanding her satisfaction, by her sonâ\\x80\\x99s indifference; â\\x80\\x9cheâ\\x80\\x99s away\\nabroad somewhere; but I would not say but what there might be another,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe continued, with natural _esprit du corps_, which was still more\\nirritated by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s calm response,--\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOr two or three others,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man; â\\x80\\x9cbut, for all that, you\\nare quite right to stand up for her, mother; only I am not in the least\\ndanger. No, I must get to work,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9chard work, without any\\nmore nonsense; but Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to show those fellows that a man may choose\\nto be a Scotch minister though he is Fellow of an English college--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Mistress interrupted her son with the nearest approach to a scream\\nwhich her Scotch self-control would admit of. â\\x80\\x9cA Fellow of an English\\ncollege,â\\x80\\x9d she said in dismay, â\\x80\\x9cand you troth-plighted to an innocent\\nyoung woman that trusts in you, Colin! That I should ever live to hear\\nsuch words out of the mouth of a son of mine!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd, notwithstanding his explanations, the Mistress retired to her own\\nroom, ill at ease, and with a sense of coming trouble. â\\x80\\x9cA man thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nengaged to be married shouldna be thinking of such an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 off-put of\\ntime,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself; â\\x80\\x9cand ah, if the poor lassie is aye trusting\\nto his coming, and looking for him day by day!â\\x80\\x9d This thought took away\\nfrom his mother half the joy of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s return. Perhaps her cherished\\nson, too, was growing â\\x80\\x9cworldly,â\\x80\\x9d like his father, who thought of the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeastsâ\\x80\\x9d even in his dreams. And, as for Colin himself, he, too, felt\\nthe invisible curb upon his free actions, and chafed at it in the depths\\nof his heart when he was alone. With all this world of work and ambition\\nbefore him, it was hard to feel upon his proud neck that visionary rein.\\nThough Alice had set him free in her little letter, it was still in her\\nsoft fingers that this shadowy bond remained. He had not repudiated it,\\neven in his most secret thoughts; but, as soon as he began to act\\nindependently, he became conscious of the bondage, and in his heart\\nresented it. If he had brought her home, as he had intended, to his\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s house, his young dependent wife, he probably would have felt\\nmuch less clearly this sense of having forestalled the future, and\\nmortgaged his very life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII.\\n\\n\\nThe Balliol Scholarship was, however, too important a reality to leave\\nthe young candidate much time to consider his position--and Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhistory would be too long, even for the patience of his friends, if we\\nwere to enter into this part of his life in detail. Everybody knows he\\nwon the scholarship; and, indeed, neither that, nor his subsequent\\ncareer at Balliol, are matters to be recorded, since the chronicle has\\nbeen already made in those popular University records which give their\\nheroes a reputation, no doubt temporary, but while it lasts of the\\nhighest possible flavour. He had so warm a greeting from Sir Thomas\\nFrankland that it would have been churlish on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s part had he\\ndeclined the invitations he received to the Castle, where, indeed, Miss\\nMatty did not want him just at that moment. Though she was not the least\\nin the world in love with him, it is certain that between the intervals\\nof her other amusements in that _genre_, the thought of Colin had often\\noccurred to her mind. She thought of him with a wonderful gratitude and\\ntenderness sometimes, as of a man who had actually loved her with the\\nimpossible love--and sometimes with a ring of pleasant laughter, not far\\nremoved from tears. Anything â\\x80\\x9cbetween themâ\\x80\\x9d was utterly impossible, of\\ncourse--but, perhaps, all the more for that, Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s heart, so much\\nas there was remaining of it, went back to Colin in its vacant moments,\\nas to a green spot upon which she could repose herself, and set down her\\nburden of vanities for the time. This very sentiment, however, made her\\nlittle inclined to have him at the Castle, where there was at present a\\nparty staying, including, at least, one man of qualifications worthy a\\nladyâ\\x80\\x99s regard. Harry and his cousin had quarrelled so often that their\\nquarrel at last was serious, and the new man was cleverer than Harry,\\nand not so hard to amuse; but it was difficult to go over the well-known\\nground with which Miss Frankland was so familiar in presence of one whom\\nshe had put through the process in a still more captivating fashion, and\\nwho was still sufficiently interested to note what she was doing, and to\\nbetray that he noted it. Colin, himself, was not so conscious of\\nobserving his old love in her new love-making as she was conscious of\\nhis observation; and, though it was only a glance now and then, a turn\\nof the head, or raising of the eyes, it was enough to make her awkward\\nby moments, an evidence of feeling for which Miss Matty could not\\nforgive herself.\\n\\nThus it happened that Colin was not thrown into temptation in the way\\nhis mother dreaded. The temptation he was thrown into was one of a much\\nmore subtle character. He rushed at his work, and the preparations for\\nhis work, with all the energy of his character; he felt himself free to\\nfollow out the highest visions of life that had formed themselves among\\nhis youthful dreams. He thought of the new study on which he was about\\nto enter, and the honours upon which he already calculated in his\\nimagination, as but stepping stones to what lay after, and offered\\nhimself up with a certain youthful effusion and super-abundance to his\\nChurch and his country, for which he had assuredly something to do more\\nthan other men. And then, when Colin had got so far as this, and was\\ntossing his young head proudly in the glory of his intentions, there\\ncame a little start and shiver, and that sense of the curb, which had\\nstruck him first after his confidence with his mother, returned to his\\nmind. But the bondage seemed to grow more and more visionary as he went\\non. Alice had given him up, so to speak; she was debarred by her father\\nfrom any correspondence with him, and might, for anything Colin knew,\\ngentle and yielding as she was, be made to marry some one else by the\\nsame authority; and, though he did not discuss the question with himself\\nin words, it became more and more hard to Colin to contemplate the\\npossibility of having to abridge his studies and sacrifice his higher\\naims to the necessity of getting â\\x80\\x9csettled in life.â\\x80\\x9d If he were â\\x80\\x9csettled\\nin lifeâ\\x80\\x9d to-morrow, it could only be as an undistinguished Scotch\\nminister, poor, so far as money was concerned, and with no higher\\nchannel either to use or fame; and, at his age, to be only like his\\nneighbours was of all things the most irksome to him.\\n\\nThose neighbours, or at least the greater part of them, were good\\nfellows enough in their way. So far as a vague general conception of\\nlife and its meaning went, they were superior as a class in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nopinion to that other clerical class represented by the gentle curate of\\nWodensbourne, whose soul was absorbed in the restoration of his Church,\\nand the fit states of mind for the Sundays after Trinity; but there were\\nalso particulars in which, as a class, they were wonderfully inferior to\\nthat mild and gentlemanly Anglican. As for Colin, he had not formed his\\nideal on any curate, or even bishop, of the wealthier Church. Like other\\nfervent young men, an eager discontent with everything he saw lay at the\\nbottom of his imaginations; and it was the development of\\nChristianity--â\\x80\\x9cmore chivalrous, more magnanimous, than that of modern\\ntimesâ\\x80\\x9d--that he thought of. A dangerous condition of mind, no doubt; and\\nthe people round him would have sneered much at Colin and his ambition\\nhad he put it into words; but, after all, it was an ideal worth\\ncontemplating which he presented to himself.\\n\\nIn the midst of such thoughts, and of all the future possibilities of\\nlife, it was a little hard to be suddenly stopped short, and reminded of\\nMariana in her moated grange, sighing, â\\x80\\x9cHe does not come.â\\x80\\x9d If he did\\ncome, making all the unspeakable sacrifices necessary to that end, as\\nhis mother seemed to think he should, the probabilities were that the\\ndoor of the grange would be closed upon him; and who could tell but that\\nAlice, always so docile, might be diverted even from the thought of him\\nby some other suitor presented to her by her father? Were Colinâ\\x80\\x99s hopes\\nto be sacrificed to her possible faith, and the possible relenting of\\nMr. Meredith? And, alas! amid all the new impulses that were rising\\nwithin him, there came again the vision of that woman in the clouds,\\nwhom as yet, though he had been in love with Matty Frankland, and had\\nall but married Alice Meredith, Colin had never seen. She kissed her\\nshadowy hand to him by times out of those rosy vapours that floated\\namong the hills when the sun had gone down, and twilight lay sweet over\\nthe Holy Loch--and beckoned him on, on, to the future and the distance\\nwhere she was. When the apparition had glanced out upon him after this\\nold fashion, Colin felt all at once the jerk of the invisible bridle on\\nhis neck, and chafed at it; and then he shut his eyes wilfully, and\\nrushed on faster than before, and did his best to ignore the curb. After\\nall, it was no curb if it were rightly regarded. Alice had released, and\\nher father had rejected him, and he had been accused of fortune-hunting,\\nand treated like a man unworthy of consideration. So far as external\\ncircumstances went, no one could blame him for inconstancy, no one could\\nimagine that the engagement thus broken was, according to any code of\\nhonour, binding upon Colin; but yet--\\n\\nThis was the uncomfortable state of mind in which he was when he finally\\ncommitted himself to the Balliol Scholarship, and thus put off that\\nâ\\x80\\x9csettling in lifeâ\\x80\\x9d which the Mistress thought due to Alice. When the\\nmatter was concluded, however, the young man became more comfortable. At\\nall events, until the termination of his studies, no decision, one way\\nor other, could be expected from him; and it would still be two years\\nbefore Alice was of the age to decide for herself. He discussed the\\nmatter--so far as he ever permitted himself to discuss it with any\\none--with Lauderdale, who managed to spend the last Sunday with him at\\nRamore. It was still only October but winter had begun betimes, and a\\nsprinkling of snow lay on the hills at the head of the loch. The water\\nitself, all crisped and brightened by a slight breeze and a frosty sun,\\nlay dazzling between its banks, reflecting every shade of colour upon\\nthem--the russet lines of wood with which their little glens were\\noutlined, and the yellow patches of stubble, or late corn, still\\nunreaped, that made lights of the landscape, and relieved the hazy green\\nof the pastures, and the brown waste of withered bracken and heather\\nabove. The wintry day, the clearness of the frosty air, and the touch of\\nsnow on the hills, gave to the Holy Loch that touch of colour which is\\nthe only thing ever wanting to its loveliness; a colour cold, it is\\ntrue, but in accordance with the scene. The waves came up with a lively\\ncadence on the beach, and the wind blew showers of yellow leaves in the\\nfaces of the two friends as they walked home together from church. Sir\\nThomas had detained them in the first place, and after him the minister,\\nwho had emerged from his little vestry in time for half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s\\nconversation with his young parishioner, who was something of a hero on\\nthe Holy Loch--a hero, and yet subject to the inevitable touch of\\nfamiliar depreciation which belongs to a prophet in his own country. The\\ncrowd of church-goers had dispersed from the roads when the two turned\\ntheir faces towards Ramore. Perhaps by reason of the yew-trees under\\nwhich they had to pass, perhaps because this Sunday, too, marked a\\ncrisis, it occurred to both of them to think of their walk through the\\nlong ilex avenues of the Frascati villa, the Sunday after Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndeath. It was Lauderdale, as was natural, who returned to that subject\\nthe first.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s a wee hard to believe that itâ\\x80\\x99s the same world,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cand\\nthat you and me are making our way to Ramore, and not to yon painted\\nchaâ\\x80\\x99amer, and our friend, with her distaff in her hand. Iâ\\x80\\x99m whiles no\\nclear in my mind that we were ever there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt which Colin was a little impatient, as was natural. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t be\\nfantastic,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt does not matter about Sora Antonia; but there\\nare other things not so easily dropped;â\\x80\\x9d and here the young man paused\\nand uttered a sigh, which arose half from a certain momentary longing\\nfor the gentle creature to whom his faith was plighted, and half from an\\nirksome sense of the disadvantages of having plighted his faith.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no fond myself of dropping threads like\\nthat. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae telling when they may be joined again, or how; but if\\nitâ\\x80\\x99s ony comfort to you, Colin, Iâ\\x80\\x99m a great believer in sequences. I\\nnever put ony faith in things breaking off clean in an arbitrary way.\\nThae two didna enter your life to be put out again by the will of an old\\nfool of a father. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no say that I saw the requirements of Providence\\njust as clear as you thought you did, but I canna put faith in an ending\\nlike whatâ\\x80\\x99s happened. You and her are awfuâ\\x80\\x99 young. You have time to\\nwait.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTime to wait,â\\x80\\x9d repeated Colin in his impatience; â\\x80\\x9cthere is something\\nmore needed than time. Mr. Meredith has returned me my last letter with\\na request that I should not trouble his daughter again. You do not\\nthink a man can go on in the face of that?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s naething but a jailor,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cyou may be sure that\\n_she_ is neither art nor part in that. When the time comes weâ\\x80\\x99ll aâ\\x80\\x99 ken\\nbetter; and here, in the meantime, you are making another beginning of\\nyour life.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt appears to me I am always making beginnings,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cIt was\\nmuch such a day as this when Harry Frankland fell into the loch--that\\nwas a kind of beginning in its way. Wodensbourne was a beginning, and so\\nwas Italy--and now--It appears life is made up of such.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYouâ\\x80\\x99re no so far wrong there,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cbut itâ\\x80\\x99s grand to make\\nthe new start like you, with aâ\\x80\\x99 heaven and earth on your side. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve kent\\nthem that had to set their face to the brae with baith earth and heaven\\nagainst them--or so it seemed. Itâ\\x80\\x99s ill getting new images,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher meditatively. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder who it was first found out that life\\nwas a journey. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no an original idea nowadays, but its aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\ntrue. A man sets out with a hantle mair things than he needs,\\n_impedimenta_ of aâ\\x80\\x99 kinds; but he leaves the maist of them behind afore\\nheâ\\x80\\x99s reached the middle of the road. Youâ\\x80\\x99ve an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 body of opinions,\\ncallant, besides other things to dispose of. Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking Oxford will do\\nyou good for that. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no likely to take up with their superfluities,\\nand youâ\\x80\\x99ll get rid of some of your ain.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you call superfluities,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t think I\\nam a man of many opinions. A few things are vital and cannot be\\ndispensed with--and these you are quite as distinct upon as I can be.\\nHowever, I donâ\\x80\\x99t go to Oxford to learn that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 curious to ken in a general way,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cwhat you\\nare going to Oxford to learn. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no a bad hand at the classics,\\ncallant. I would like to ken what it was that you were meaning to pay\\nthree good years of life to learn.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Colin laughed, and felt without knowing why, a flush come to\\nhis cheek. â\\x80\\x9cIf I should prefer to win my spurs somewhere else than at\\nhome,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man lightly, â\\x80\\x9cshould you wonder at that? Beside,\\nthe English universities have a greater reputation than ours--and in\\nshort----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor idle learning,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale with a little heat; â\\x80\\x9cnot for the\\nscience of guiding men, which, so far as I can see, is what youâ\\x80\\x99re\\naiming at. No that Iâ\\x80\\x99m the man to speak ony blasphemy against the dead\\nlanguages, if the like of that was to be your trade; but for a Scotch\\nparish, or maybe a Scotch presbytery--or in the course of time, if aâ\\x80\\x99\\ngoes well, an Assembly of the Kirk----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cStuff!â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin; â\\x80\\x9cWhat has that to do with it? Besides,â\\x80\\x9d the young\\nman said with a laugh, half of pride, half of shame, â\\x80\\x9cI want to show\\nthese fellows that a man may win their honours and carry them back to\\nthe old Church, which they talk about in a benevolent way, as if it was\\nin the South Sea Islands. Well, that is my weakness. I want to bring\\ntheir prizes back here, and wear them at home.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe callantâ\\x80\\x99s crazy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, but the idea was sufficiently in\\naccord with his national sentiments to be treated with indulgence; â\\x80\\x9cit\\nmight maybe be spoiling the Egyptians,â\\x80\\x9d he added grimly, â\\x80\\x9cbut, as for\\nony good to us--Youâ\\x80\\x99re like aâ\\x80\\x99 young creatures, callant; youâ\\x80\\x99re awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nfond of the _impedimenta_. But you may change your mind two or three\\ntimes over between this and that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou have very little respect for my constancy, Lauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin;\\nand then he felt irritated with himself for the word he had used. â\\x80\\x9cIn\\nwhat respect do you suppose I can change my mind?â\\x80\\x9d he asked with a\\nlittle impatience; and Colin lifted his eyes full upon his friendâ\\x80\\x99s\\nface, as he had learned to do when there was question of Alice--though\\ncertainly it could not be supposed that there was any question of Alice\\nin the present case.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhisht, callant,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 trust in your\\nconstancy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one oâ\\x80\\x99 the words I like best in the English language, or\\nin the Scotch either for that matter. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a kind of word that canna be\\nslipped over among a crowd, but craves full saying and aâ\\x80\\x99 its letters\\nsounded. As I was saying,â\\x80\\x9d he continued, changing his tone, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m a great\\nbeliever in sequences; thereâ\\x80\\x99s mony new beginnings, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae\\nabsolute end short of dying, which is aye an end for this world, so far\\nas a man can see. And, next to God and Christ, which are the grand\\nprimitive necessities, without which no man can take his journey, Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\naye for counting true love and good faith. I wouldna say but what aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nrest were more or less _impedimenta_,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cbut thatâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nthe question under discussion. You might change your mind upon aâ\\x80\\x99 the\\nminor matters, and no be inconstant. For example, you might be drawn to\\nthe English kirk after three years; or you might come to think you were\\ndestined for nae kirk at all, but for other occupations in this world;\\nand, as for me, I wouldna blame you. As long as youâ\\x80\\x99re true to your\\nMaster--and next to yourselâ\\x80\\x99--and next to them that trust you,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s faithful counsellor; â\\x80\\x9cand of that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve no fear.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI did not think of setting the question on such a solemn basis,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin with an amount of irritation which annoyed himself, and which he\\ncould not subdue; â\\x80\\x9chowever, time will show; and here we are at Ramore.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIndeed he was rather glad to be so near Ramore. This talk of constancy\\nexasperated him, he could not tell how; for, to be sure, he meant no\\ninconstancy. Yet, when the sunset came again, detaching rosy cloudlets\\nfrom the great masses of vapour, and shedding a mist of gold and purple\\nover the hills--and when those wistful stretches of â\\x80\\x9cdaffodil skyâ\\x80\\x9d\\nopened out over the western ramparts of the Holy Loch--Colin turned his\\neyes from the wonderful heavens as if from a visible enemy. Was not she\\nthere as always, that impossible woman, wooing him on into the future,\\ninto the unimaginable distance where somewhere she might be found any\\nday waiting him? He turned his back upon the west, and went down of his\\nown will to the dark shade of the yew-trees, which were somehow like the\\nilex alleys of the sweet Alban hills; but even there he carried his\\nimpatience with him, and found it best on the whole to go home and give\\nhimself up to the home talk of Ramore, in which many matters were\\ndiscussed unconnected with the beasts, but where this one fundamental\\nquestion was for the present named no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII.\\n\\n\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s career at Oxford does not lie in the way of his present\\nhistorian, though, to be sure, a few piquant particulars might be\\nselected of the way in which a pair of young Scotch eyes, with a light\\nin them somewhat akin to genius, but trained to see the realities of\\nhomely life on the Holy Loch, regarded the peculiar existence of the\\nsteady, artificial old world, and the riotous but submissive new world,\\nwhich between them form a university. Colin who, like most of his\\ncountrymen, found a great deal of the â\\x80\\x9cwitâ\\x80\\x9d of the community around him\\nto be sheer nonsense, sometimes agreeable, sometimes much the reverse,\\nhad also like his nation a latent but powerful sense of humour, which,\\nbacked by a few prejudices, and stimulated a little by the different\\nmanners current in the class to which he himself belonged, revealed to\\nhim many wonderful absurdities in the unconscious microcosm which felt\\nitself a universe;--a revelation which restored any inequality in the\\nbalance of affairs, and made the Scotch undergraduate at his ease in his\\nnew circumstances. For his own part, he stood in quite a different\\nposition from the host of young men, most of them younger than himself,\\nby whom he found himself surrounded. They were accomplishing without any\\nvery definite object the natural and usual course of their education--a\\nprocess which everybody had to go through, and which, with more or less\\ncredit, their fathers, brothers, friends, and relatives had passed\\nthrough before them. Life beyond the walls of the University had\\ndoubtless objects more interesting than the present routine; but there\\nwas no such immediate connexion between those objects and that routine\\nas Colin had been accustomed to see in his Scotch college.\\n\\nAs for Colin himself, he was aiming at a special end, which made his\\ncourse distinct for him among his more careless companions; he was bent\\non the highest honours attainable by hard work and powers much above the\\naverage; and this determination would have acted as a moral shield to\\nhim against the meaner temptations of the place, even if he had not\\nalready been by disposition and habits impervious to them. The higher\\ndanger--the many temptations to which Colin, like other young men, was\\nexposed, of contenting himself with a brilliant unproductive social\\nreputation--was warded off from him by the settled determination with\\nwhich he entered upon his work. For Scotch sentiment is very distinct on\\nthis question; and Colin understood perfectly that, if he returned with\\nonly a moderate success, his _Alma Mater_ would be utterly disgusted\\nwith her pet student, and his reputation would fall to a considerably\\nlower ebb than if he had been content to stay at home. He came upon that\\ntranquil academic scene in the true spirit of an invader; not\\nunfriendly--on the contrary, a keen observer of everything, an eager and\\ninterested spectator of all the peculiar habitudes of the foreign\\ncountry--but chiefly bent upon snatching the laurel, as soon as that\\nshould be possible, and carrying home his spoil in triumph. He entered\\nOxford, in short, as the Czar Peter, had he been less a savage, might\\nhave been supposed to establish himself in the bosom of the homely\\nEnglish society of his time, seeing, with eyes brightened by curiosity\\nand the novelty of the spectacle, various matters in a ridiculous light\\nwhich were performed with the utmost gravity and unconsciousness by the\\naccustomed inhabitants; and, on the other hand, discovering as many\\nparticulars from which he might borrow some advantage to his own people.\\nCertainly, Czar Peter, who was at once an absolute monarch and the most\\nenlightened man of his nation, stood in a somewhat different position\\nfrom the nameless Scotch student, between whom and other Scotch students\\nno ordinary observer could have discovered much difference; but the\\naspirations of young men of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s age are fortunately unlimited by\\nreason, and the plan he had conceived of working a revolution in his\\nnative Church and country, or, at least, aiming at that to the highest\\nextent of his powers, was as legitimate, to say the least, as the\\ndetermination to make a great fortune, with which other young men of his\\nnation have often confronted the world.\\n\\nColin frequented the Oxford churches as he had frequented those in Rome,\\nwith his paramount idea in his mind, and listened to the sermons in them\\nwith that prevailing reference to the audience which he himself looked\\nforward to, which gave so strange an aspect to much that he heard. To be\\nsure, it was not the best way to draw religious advantage for himself\\nfrom the teachings he listened to; but yet the process was not without\\nits benefits to the predestined priest. He seemed to himself to be\\nlooking on while the University preacher delivered his dignified\\nperiods, not to the actual assembly, but to a shrewd and steady Scotch\\ncongregation, not easily moved either to reverence or enthusiasm, and\\nwith a national sense of logic. He could not help smiling to himself\\nwhen, in the midst of some elaborate piece of reasoning, the least\\nlittle step aside landed the speaker upon that quagmire of\\necclesiastical authority which with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s audience would go far to\\nneutralize all the argument. The young man fancied he could see the\\nelders shake their heads, and the rural philosophers remark to each\\nother, â\\x80\\x9cHe maun have been awfuâ\\x80\\x99 ill off for an argument afore he landed\\nupon yon.â\\x80\\x9d And, when the preacher proceeded to â\\x80\\x9cour Churchâ\\x80\\x99s admirable\\narrangements,â\\x80\\x9d and displayed with calm distinctness the final certainty\\nthat perfection had been absolutely attained by that venerated mother,\\nthe young Scotchman felt a prick of contradiction in his heart on his\\nown account as well as that of his imaginary audience. He thought to\\nhimself that the same arguments employed on behalf of the Church of\\nScotland would go a long way towards unsettling the national faith, and\\nsmiled within himself at the undoubting assumption which his\\ncontradictory northern soul was so far from accepting. He was not a bad\\nemblem of his nation in this particular, at least. He consented without\\na remonstrance to matters of detail, such as were supposed, by anybody\\nwho had curiosity enough to inquire into the singular semi-savage\\nreligious practices of Scotland, to be specially discordant to the ideas\\nof his country; but he laughed at â\\x80\\x9cour Churchâ\\x80\\x99s admirable arrangementsâ\\x80\\x9d\\nin such a manner as to set the hair of the University on end. The\\nprinciples of apostolic succession and unbroken ecclesiastical descent\\nproduced in this daring young sceptic, not indignation nor argument,\\nwhich might have been tolerated, but an amused disregard which was\\nunbearable. He was always so conscious of what his Scotch audience,\\nburied somewhere among the hills in the seclusion of a country parish,\\nwould think of such pretensions, and laughed not at the doctrine so much\\nas at the thought of their reception of it. In this respect the young\\nScotchman, embodying his country, was the most contradictory of men.\\n\\nHe was not very much more satisfactory in the other region, where the\\nbest of Anglicans occasionally wander, and where men who hold with the\\nfirmest conviction the doctrine of apostolic succession sometimes show a\\nstrange degree of uncertainly about things more important. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nconvictions were vague enough on a great many matters which were\\nconsidered vital on the Holy Loch; and perhaps he was not a much more\\nsatisfactory bearer in his parish church at home than he was in Oxford\\nwhen there was question of the descendants of the apostles. But amidst\\nthis sea of vague and undeveloped thought, which was not so much doubt\\nas uncertainty, there stood up several rocks of absolute faith which\\nwere utterly impervious to assault. His mind was so far conformed to his\\nage that he could hear even these ultimate and fundamental matters\\ncanvassed by the calm philosophers about him, without any undue\\ntheological heat or passion of defence; but it soon became evident that\\non these points the young Scotchman was immovable, a certainty which\\nmade him an interesting study to some of his companions and teachers. It\\nwould be foolish to say that his faith procured for him that awe and\\nrespect which the popular mind takes it for granted a company of\\nsceptics must always feel for the one among them who retains his\\nreligious convictions. On the contrary, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s world was amused by his\\nbelief. It was, itself to start with, a perfectly pious, well-conducted\\nworld, saying its prayers like everybody else, and containing nothing\\nwithin its placid bosom which in the least resembled the free-thinkers\\nof ancient days. The Church was not the least in the world in danger\\nfrom that mild fraternity, to which every kind of faith was a thing to\\nbe talked about, to evolve lines of thought upon, and give rise to the\\nmost refined, and acute, and charming conversation. But, as for Colin,\\nthey regarded him with amused observation as a rare specimen of the\\nsemi-cultivated, semi-savage intelligence which is always so refreshing\\nto a society which has refined itself to a point somewhat beyond nature.\\nHe was â\\x80\\x9ca most interesting young man,â\\x80\\x9d and they found in him â\\x80\\x9ca\\nbeautiful enthusiasm,â\\x80\\x9d an â\\x80\\x9cengaging simplicity.â\\x80\\x9d As for Colin, he was\\nquite aware of the somewhat unfounded admiration with which he was\\nregarded, and smiled in his turn at his observers with a truer\\nconsciousness of the humour of the position than they could possibly\\nhave who saw only half of it; but he kept his shrewd Scotch eyes open\\nall the time, and half unconsciously made himself acquainted with a\\ngreat many new developments of that humanity which was to be the\\nmaterial of all the labours of his life. He had it in his power to\\nremark the exact and delicate points at which Anglicanism joined on to\\nthe newer fashion of intellectualism, and to note how a morsel of faith\\nthe less might be now and then conciliated and made up for by a morsel\\nof observance the more. And, at the same time, he became aware of the\\nconvenient possibility of dividing a man, and making him into two or\\nthree different â\\x80\\x9cbeings,â\\x80\\x9d as occasion required; so that the emotional\\nbeing--having sundry natural weaknesses, such as old association and\\nyouthful habit, and a regard to the feelings of others, not to speak of\\nthe affectionate prejudices of a good Churchman--was quite free to do\\nhis daily service at chapel, and say his prayers, even at the very\\nmoment when the intellectual being was busy with the most delicate\\ndemonstration that prayer in a universe governed by absolute law was an\\nevident absurdity and contradiction of all reason. Colin for his part\\nlooked on at this partition, and smiled in his turn. He was not shocked,\\nas perhaps he ought to have been; but then, as has been said, he too was\\na man of his age, and found many things which were required by absolute\\northodoxy unnecessary _impedimenta_, as Lauderdale had called them.\\n\\nBut, with all this, the young man had never been able to cut himself in\\nhalf, and he could not learn to regard the process as one either\\nadvantageous or even honourable now.\\n\\nSuch, apart from the work which was necessary in obedience to his grand\\noriginal impulse, were the studies he pursued in Oxford. At the same\\ntime he had another occupation in hand, strangely out of accord at once\\nwith those studies and with his own thoughts. This was the publication\\nof poor Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s book, the â\\x80\\x9cVoice from the Grave,â\\x80\\x9d at which he had\\nlaboured to the latest moment of his life. In it was represented another\\nworld, an altogether contradictory type of existence. Between Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nintellectual friends, to whom the â\\x80\\x9cHereafterâ\\x80\\x9d was a curious and\\ninteresting but altogether baffling subject of investigation, and the\\ndying youth who had gone out of this world in a dauntless primitive\\nconfidence of finding himself at once in the shining streets and endless\\nsunshine of the New Jerusalem, the difference was so great as to be past\\ncounting. As for the young editor, his view of life was as different\\nfrom Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s as it was from that of his present companions. The great\\nlight of heaven was to Colin, as to many others, as impenetrable as the\\nprofoundest darkness; he could neither see into it, nor permit himself\\nto make guesses of what was going on beyond; and, consequently, he had\\nlittle sympathy with the kind of piety which regards life as a\\npreparation for death. Sometimes he smiled, sometimes he sighed over the\\nproofs as he corrected them; sometimes, but for knowing as he did the\\nutter truthfulness with which the dead writer had set forth his\\none-sided and narrow conception of the world, Colin would have been\\ndisposed to toss into the fire those strange warnings and exhortations.\\nBut when he thought of the young author, dead in his youth, and of all\\nthe doings and sayings of those months in which they lived together,\\nand, more touching still, of those conversations that were held on the\\nvery brink of the grave, and at the gate of heaven, his heart smote him.\\nAnd then his new friends broke in upon him, and discussed the book with\\nopinions so various that Colin could but admire and wonder. One\\nconsidered them a curious study of the internal consciousness, quite\\nworthy the attention of a student of mental phenomena. Another was of\\nopinion that such stuff was the kind of nutriment fit for the uneducated\\nclasses, who had strong religious prejudices, and no brains to speak of.\\nWhen Colin found his own sentiments thrown back to him in this careless\\nfashion, he began to see for the first time the conceit and\\nself-importance of his judgment; and many discussions followed, as might\\nbe supposed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhen religion becomes a matter of self-interest,â\\x80\\x9d said one of the young\\nmen met in his rooms on one such occasion, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see any attraction\\nin it. I donâ\\x80\\x99t understand what you can see in this rubbish, Campbell.\\nInflated humbug and sordid calculations----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHush!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a sparkle in his eyes, â\\x80\\x9cthe writer was of the\\nkind of man that saints were once made of--and I believe in saints for\\nmy part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said his interlocutor; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to be vulgar: one\\ncanâ\\x80\\x99t help to a certain extent believing in saints--though our wise\\nfathers you know thought otherwise.â\\x80\\x9d Perhaps the young speaker would not\\nhave thought it necessary to be civil to them, if it had not been that a\\nformer generation had made fun of the saints.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd as for self-interest,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see how a man can have\\nan altogether generous and patronizing love for God. A childâ\\x80\\x99s love for\\nhis father is always interested in a kind of way. The love that has no\\nself-regard in it, is pity or patronage rather than love.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, love!â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend, who had not been altogether thinking of\\nthat; and then another speaker broke in.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFor my part, it is the emotional aspect of religion that chiefly\\ninterests me,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cin a philosophical point of view, you know. But\\nthe only way you can influence the masses is by working on their\\nfeelings. It would be different, of course, with a set of fellows like\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe are superior to that sort of thing,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cPerhaps we have no\\nfeelings. When a man becomes a Don, I donâ\\x80\\x99t see what use he has for such\\nsuperfluities.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou are going to be a Don yourself, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said some one. â\\x80\\x9cYou are\\nsure of your Fellowship, of course.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Colin smiled with the pleasant arrogance of his age.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSomething better than that,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI am not the kind of stuff that\\nDons are made of. I am going home to Scotland to the Kirk.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThough his friends were all aware of this magnanimous intention, they\\ncould not but open their eyes at every new repetition of it.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf you have set your heart on being a parson,â\\x80\\x9d one of his companions\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cgo into the Church, at least. Hang it! Campbell, donâ\\x80\\x99t go and\\nbind yourself to a conventicle,â\\x80\\x9d said his anxious acquaintance; â\\x80\\x9ca man\\nhas always a chance of doing something in the Church.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is precisely my idea,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, â\\x80\\x9cthough you fellows seem to\\nthink it the last possibility. And, besides, it is the only thing I can\\ndo. I canâ\\x80\\x99t be a statesman, as you have the chance of being, and I have\\nnot an estate to manage. What else would you have me do?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow,â\\x80\\x9d said another of his friends, â\\x80\\x9cyou are as sure of your\\nFellowship as any man ever was. Go in for literature, and send your old\\nKirk to Jericho--a fellow like you has nothing to do in such a place.\\nOne knows the sort of thing precisely; any blockhead that can thump his\\npulpit, and drone out long prayers--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMany thanks for your advice,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut I prefer my own\\nprofession, literature is all very well when a man is born to it, but\\nlife is better than literature at its best; and my own trade should be\\ngood for something, if any profession ever was.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell, now, taking it at the very best, how much do you think you are\\nlikely to have a-year?--a hundred and fifty perhaps? No, I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to\\nsay thatâ\\x80\\x99s final;--but, of course, a thoughtful fellow like you takes it\\ninto consideration,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s adviser; â\\x80\\x9ceverything is badly paid\\nnow-a-days--but, at all events, there are chances. If a man is made of\\niron and brass, and has the resolution of an elephant, he may get to be\\nsomething at the Bar, you know, and make a mint of money. And, even in\\nthe Church, to be sure, if heâ\\x80\\x99s harmless and civil, something worth\\nhaving may come in his way; but you are neither civil nor harmless,\\nCampbell. And, by Jove! itâ\\x80\\x99s not the Church you are thinking of, but the\\nKirk, which is totally different. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been in Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d continued the\\nMentor, with animation; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s not even one Kirk, which would be\\nsomething. But thereâ\\x80\\x99s one at the top of the hill and one at the bottom,\\nand I defy any man to tell which is which. Come, Campbell, donâ\\x80\\x99t be a\\nQuixote--give it up!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou might as well have told my namesake to give up the Queenâ\\x80\\x99s service\\nafter he had lost a battle,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cThough I donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose Sir\\nColin ever did lose a battle, by the way. I tell you I am not the sort\\nof stuff for a Don--the atmosphere is too much rarified up here--I canâ\\x80\\x99t\\nbreathe in it. Men who come of my race must work or die.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t say that I feel the force of the alternative,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfriend. â\\x80\\x9cA man must think; it is the first condition of existence; but\\nas for the other two-- What have you in common with the unreasoning\\nmultitude?â\\x80\\x9d asked the young philosopher. There were plenty of voices to\\ntake the other side of the question, but Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind was not political\\nto speak of, and he had no inclination to take the democratic side.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA few things,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said, with a smile, â\\x80\\x9cthat donâ\\x80\\x99t exist among the\\nIlluminati. For instance, ignorance and want and some other human\\nattributes; and we can help each other on down below, while you are\\nthinking it all out above. The worst is that we will probably find time\\nto live and die before you come to any conclusion. Let us talk it over\\nten years hence,â\\x80\\x9d said this young prince of the future, with royal\\nconfidence. And this was how a great many such conversations came to an\\nend.\\n\\nTen years was like to be an eventful period to the young men who were\\nstanding on the verge of life; but they all made very light of it, as\\nwas natural. As for Colin, he did not attempt to make out to himself any\\nclear plan of what he attempted to do and to be in ten years. Certainly,\\nhe calculated upon having by that time reached the highest culmination\\nof which life was capable. He meant to be a prince in his own country\\nwithout, at the same time, following anything for his own glory or\\nadvantage; for in reality, the highest projects that could move the\\nspirit of a man were in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind. He had no thought of becoming a\\npopular preacher, or the oracle of a coterie. What he truly intended\\nindeed was not quite known to himself, in the vague but magnificent\\nstirrings of his ambition. He meant to take possession of some certain\\ncorner of his native country, and make of it an ideal Scotland, manful\\nin works and steadfast in belief; and he meant from that corner to\\ninfluence and move all the land in some mystical method known only to\\nthe imagination. Such are the splendid colours in which fancy, when\\nsufficiently lively, can dress up even such a sober reality as the life\\nof a Scotch minister. While he planned this he seemed to himself so\\nentirely a man of experience, ready to smile at the notions of\\nundisciplined youth, that he succeeded in altogether checking and\\ndeceiving his own inevitable good sense--that watchful monitor which\\nwarns even an imaginative mind of its extravagance. This was the great\\ndream which, interrupted now and then by lighter fancies, had\\naccompanied Colin more or less clearly through all his life. And now the\\nhour of trial was about to come, and the young manâ\\x80\\x99s ambition was ready\\nto accomplish itself as best it might.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIV.\\n\\n\\nIt is unnecessary to say that Colin won the prize on which he had set\\nhis heart. The record is extant in the University, to save his historian\\ntrouble; and, to be sure, nobody can be supposed to be ignorant on so\\nimportant a point--at least nobody who is anybody and has a character\\nto support. He took a double first-class--as he had set his heart on\\ndoing--and thereby obtained, as some great man once said in a speech, an\\nequal standing to that of a duke in English society. It is to be feared\\nthat Colin did not experience the full benefits of his elevation; for,\\nto be sure, such a dukedom is of a temporary character, and was scarcely\\nlikely to survive beyond his year. But the prize when it was won, and\\nall the long details of the process of winning it, were not without\\ntheir effect upon him. Colin, being still young and inexperienced, had,\\nindeed, the idea that the possessor of such a distinction needed but to\\nsignify his august will, and straightway every possible avenue of\\nadvancement would open before him. But for that idea, the pride of\\ncarrying home his honours, and laying them at the feet of his native\\nchurch and country, would have been much lessened; and, to tell the\\ntruth, when the moment of triumph came, Colin yielded a little to the\\nintoxication, and lent his thoughts, in spite of himself, to those\\ncharmed voices of ambition which, in every allegory that ever was\\ninvented, exercise their siren influence on the young man at the\\nbeginning of his career. He waited to be wooed at that eventful moment.\\nHe had a vague idea at the bottom of his heart that the State and the\\nChurch, and the Bar and the Press, would all come forward open-armed to\\ntempt the hero of the year; and he had nobly determined to turn a deaf\\near to all their temptations, and cling to his natural vocation, the\\nprofession to which he had been destined from his cradle with a\\nconstancy to which the world could not fail to do honour. Colin\\naccordingly took possession of his honours with a little expectation,\\nand waited for the siren-voices. When they did not come, the young man\\nwas a little astonished, a little mortified and cast down for the\\nmoment. But after that, happily, the absurdity of the position struck\\nhim. He burst into sudden laughter in his rooms, where he sat in all the\\nnew gloss of his fame and dignity, with much congratulations from his\\nfriends, but no particular excitement on the part of the world. Great\\nBritain, as it appeared, for the moment, was not so urgently in want of\\na new Secretary of State as to contest the matter with the anonymous\\nScotch parish which had a claim upon the young man as its minister; and\\nneither the _Times_ nor the _Quarterly Review_ put forth any pretensions\\nto him. And University life, to which he might have had a successful\\n_entrÃ©e_, did not exercise any charm upon Colin. A tutorship, though\\nwith unlimited prospect of pupils, or even a final hope of reaching the\\naugust elevation of Master, was not the vocation on which he had set\\nhis heart. The consequence was, as we have said, that the new Fellow of\\nBalliol remained expectant for some time, then began to feel mortified\\nand disappointed, and finally arose, with a storm of half-indignant\\nlaughter, to find that, after all, his position was not vitally changed\\nby his success.\\n\\nThis was a strange, and perhaps in some respects a painful, discovery\\nfor a young man to make. He had distinguished himself among his fellows\\nas much as a young soldier who had made himself the hero of a campaign\\nwould have distinguished himself among his; but this fact had very\\nlittle effect upon his entry into the world. If he had been the Dukeâ\\x80\\x99s\\nson, his first-class glories would have been a graceful addition to the\\nnatural honours of his name, and perhaps might have turned towards him\\nwith favour the eyes of some of those great persons who hold the keys of\\noffice in their hands. But Colin was only the farmer of Ramoreâ\\x80\\x99s son,\\nand his prize did him no more good than any other useless laurel--except\\nindeed that it might have helped him to advancement in the way of\\npupils, had that been Colinâ\\x80\\x99s _rÃ´le_. But, considering how honourable a\\ntask it is to rear the new generation, it is astonishing how little\\nenthusiasm generally exists among young men for that fine and worthy\\noffice. Colin had not the least desire to devote himself henceforward to\\nthe production of other first-class men--though, doubtless, that would\\nhave been a very laudable object of ambition; and, notwithstanding his\\nknown devotion to the â\\x80\\x9cKirk,â\\x80\\x9d as his Oxford friends liked to call it,\\nthe young man was, no doubt, a little disappointed to find himself\\nentirely at liberty to pursue his vocation. To be sure, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9csetâ\\x80\\x9d\\nstill remonstrated against his self-immolation, and assured him that\\nwith his advantages fabulous things might be done. But the young\\nScotsman was too clear-sighted not to see that a great many of his\\ncongratulating friends had a very faint idea what to do with themselves,\\nthough some of them were but a step or two beneath him in honours. And,\\nin the meantime, Colin felt quite conscious that the world gave no sign\\nof wanting him, nor even availed itself of the commonest opportunities\\nof seeking his invaluable services. A man who takes such a discovery in\\ngood part, and can turn back without bitterness upon his original\\nintentions, is generally a man good for something; and this is precisely\\nwhat, with much less flourish of trumpets than at the beginning, Colin\\nfound it necessary to do.\\n\\nBut he was not sorry to pay a visit to Wodensbourne, where he was\\ninvited after his victory, and to take a little time to think it all\\nover. Wodensbourne had always been a kind of half-way house. It stood\\nbetween him and his youthful life, with its limited external\\ncircumstances and unlimited expectations--and that other _real_\\nlife--the life of the man, wonderfully enlarged in outward detail, and\\nmiraculously shrunk and confined in expectation--which, by the force of\\ncontrast, young as he was, seemed to make two men of Colin. It was there\\nfirst that he had learned to distinguish between the brilliant peasant\\nfirmament of Ramore, full of indistinct mists of glory, underneath which\\neverything was possible--an atmosphere in which poor men rose to the\\nsteps of the throne, and princesses married pages, and the world was\\nstill young and fresh and primitive; and that more real sky in which the\\nplanets shone fixed and unapproachable, and where everything was bound\\nby bonds of law and order, forbidding miracle. The more Colin had\\nadvanced, the more had he found advancement impossible according to the\\nideas entertained of it in his original sphere; and it was at\\nWodensbourne that he had first made this grand discovery. It was there\\nhe had learned the impossibility of the fundamental romance which at the\\nbottom of their hearts most people like to believe in;--of that love\\nwhich can leap over half a world to unite two people and to make them\\nhappy ever after, in spite not only of differences of fortune but of the\\nfar larger and greater differences by which society is regulated. Colin\\nwas on perfectly pleasant terms with Miss Matty by this time, and did\\nnot hide from himself how much he owed to her,--though perhaps she, who\\nowed to him a momentary perception of the possibility which she had\\nproved to his heart and understanding to be impossible, would have been\\nbut little grateful had she been made aware of the nature of his\\nindebtedness. But now, having made still another discovery in his life,\\nthe young man was pleased to come to Wodensbourne to think over it, and\\nmake out what it meant. And the Franklands were, as always, very kind to\\nColin. Miss Matty, who had had a great many nibbles in the interval, was\\nat length on the eve of being married. And Harry, who had nothing\\nparticular to do, and who found Wodensbourne stupid now that he was not\\nto marry his cousin, was abroad, nobody seemed exactly to know where;\\nand various things, not altogether joyful, had happened in the family,\\nsince the far-distant age when Colin was the tutor, and had been willing\\nfor Miss Mattyâ\\x80\\x99s sake to resign everything, if it should even be his\\nlife.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will be a very nice marriage,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland. â\\x80\\x9cI will not\\nconceal from you, Mr. Campbell, that Matty has been very thoughtless,\\nand given us a great deal of anxiety. It is always so much more\\ndifficult, you know, when you have the charge of a girl who is not your\\nown child. One can say anything to oneâ\\x80\\x99s own child; but your niece, you\\nknow--and, indeed, not even your own, but your husbandâ\\x80\\x99s niece----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut I am sure Miss Frankland is as much attached to you,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin,\\nwho did not like to hear Matty blamed, â\\x80\\x9cas if----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Lady Frankland; â\\x80\\x9cbut still it is different. You must not\\nthink I am the least vexed about Harry. I never thought her the proper\\nperson for Harry. He has so much feeling, though strangers do not see\\nit; and if he had been disappointed in his wife after they were married,\\nfancy what my feelings would have been, Mr. Campbell. I was always sure\\nthey never would have got on together; and you know, when that is the\\ncase, it is so much better to break off at once.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat is that you are saying about breaking off at once?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss\\nMatty, who came into the room at that moment. â\\x80\\x9cIt must be Mr. Campbell\\nwho is consulting you, aunt. I thought he would have asked _my_ advice\\nin such a case. I do believe my lady has forgotten that there ever was a\\ntime when she was not married and settled, and that is why she gives you\\nsuch cruel advice. Mr. Campbell, I am much the best counsellor, and I\\nbeg of you, donâ\\x80\\x99t break it off at once!â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, looking up in\\nhis face with eyes that were half mocking and half pathetic. She knew\\nvery well it was herself whom my lady had been talking of--which made\\nher the more disposed to send back the arrow upon Colin. But Matty,\\nafter all, was a good deal disconcerted--more disconcerted than he was,\\nwhen she saw the sudden flush that came to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s face. Naturally, no\\nwoman likes to make the discovery that a man who has once been her\\nworshipper has learned to transfer his affections to somebody else. When\\nshe saw that this chance shaft had touched him, she herself was\\nconscious of a sudden flush--a flush which had nothing whatever to do\\nwith love, but proceeded from the indescribable momentary vexation and\\nirritation with which she regarded Colinâ\\x80\\x99s desertion. That he was her\\nadorer no longer was a fact which she had consented to; but Miss Matty\\nexperienced a natural movement of indignation when she perceived that he\\nhad elevated some one else to the vacant place. â\\x80\\x9cOh, if you look like\\nthat, I shall think it quite unnecessary to advise,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with a\\nlittle spitefulness, lowering her voice.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do I look like?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin with a smile; for Lady Frankland had\\nwithdrawn to the other end of the room, and the young man was perfectly\\ndisposed to enter upon one of the half-mocking, half-tender\\nconversations which had given such a charm to his life of old.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat do you look like?â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty. â\\x80\\x9cWell, I think you look a\\ngreat deal more like other people than you used to do; and I hate men\\nwho look like everybody else. One can generally tell a woman by her\\ndress,â\\x80\\x9d said the young lady pensively; â\\x80\\x9cbut most men that one meets in\\nsociety want to have little labels with their names on them. I never can\\ntell any difference between one and another for my part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThen perhaps it would clear the haze a little if I were to name\\nmyself,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI am Colin Campbell of Ramore, at your ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s\\nservice--once tutor to the learned and witty Charley, that hope of the\\nhouse of Wodensbourne--and once also your ladyshipâ\\x80\\x99s humble boatman and\\nattendant on the Holy Loch.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cFellow of Balliol, double-first--Coming man, and reformer of Scotland,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Miss Matty with a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cYes, I recognise you; but I am not my\\nladyship just yet. I am only Matty Frankland for the moment, Sir\\nThomasâ\\x80\\x99s niece, who has given my lady a great deal of trouble. Oh, yes;\\nI know what she was saying to you. Girls who live in other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s\\nhouses know by instinct what is being said about them. Oh, to be sure,\\nit is quite true; they have been very, very kind to me; but, donâ\\x80\\x99t you\\nknow, it is dreadful always to feel that people are kind. Ah! how sweet\\nit used to be on the Holy Loch. But you have forgotten one of your\\nqualifications, Mr. Campbell; you used to be a poet as well as tutor. I\\nthink, so far as I was concerned, it was the former capacity which you\\nexercised with most applause. I have a drawer in my desk full of certain\\neffusions; but, I suppose, now you are a Fellow of Balliol you are too\\ndignified for that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t see any reason why I should be,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI was a great\\ndeal more dignified, for that matter, when I was eighteen, and a student\\nat Glasgow College, and had very much more lofty expectations than now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, you always were devoted to the Kirk,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty; â\\x80\\x9cwhich was a\\nthing I never could understand--and now less than ever, when everybody\\nknows that a man who has taken such honours as you have, has everything\\nopen to him.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cbut then what everybody knows is a little vague. I\\nshould like to hear of any one thing that really is open to me except\\ntaking pupils. Of course,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, with dignity, â\\x80\\x9cmy mind is\\nmade up long ago, and my profession fixed; but for the good of other\\npeople in my position--and for my own good as well,â\\x80\\x9d Colin added with a\\nlaugh--â\\x80\\x9cfor you know it is pleasant to feel oneâ\\x80\\x99s-self a martyr,\\nrejecting every sort of advantage for dutyâ\\x80\\x99s sake.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, but of course it is quite true,â\\x80\\x9d said Matty; â\\x80\\x9cyou _are_ giving up\\neverything--of course it is true. You know you might go into Parliament,\\nor you might go into the Church, or you might--I wish you would speak to\\nmy uncle about it; I suppose he knows. For my part, I think you should\\ngo into Parliament; I should read all your speeches faithfully, and\\nalways be on your side.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat is a great inducement,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWith that certainty one could\\nface a great many obstacles. But, on the other hand, when I have settled\\ndown somewhere in my own parish, you can come and hear me preach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat will not be half so interesting,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, making a little\\n_moue_ of disdain; â\\x80\\x9cbut, now, tell me,â\\x80\\x9d she continued, sinking her voice\\nto its most confidential tone, â\\x80\\x9cwhat it was that made you look so?--you\\nknow we are _very_ old friends,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, with the least little\\ntender touch or pathos; â\\x80\\x9cwe have done such quantities of things\\ntogether--rowed on the Holy Loch, and walked in the woods, and discussed\\nTennyson, and amused Sir Thomas--you _ought_ to tell me your secrets;\\nyou donâ\\x80\\x99t know what a good _confidante_ I should be; and if I know the\\nlady---- But, at all events, you must tell me what made you look so?â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said, with her sweetest tone of inquisitive sympathy, the siren of\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s youth.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPerhaps--when you have explained to me what it means to look _so_,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid Colin; â\\x80\\x9cafter being buried for three years one forgets that little\\nlanguage. And then I am disposed to deny ever having looked _so_,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nwent on, laughing; but, notwithstanding his laugh, Colin was much more\\nannoyed than became his reasonable years and new dignities to feel once\\nmore that absurd crimson rising to his hair. The more he laughed the\\nhigher rose that guilty and conscious colour; and, as for Miss Matty,\\nshe pointed her little pink finger at him with an air of triumph.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThere!â\\x80\\x9d she said, â\\x80\\x9cand you dare to pretend that you never looked _so_!\\nI shall be quite vexed if you donâ\\x80\\x99t tell me. If it was not something\\nvery serious,â\\x80\\x9d said Miss Matty, â\\x80\\x9cyou would not change like _that_.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHere is Sir Thomas; he will never accuse me of looking _so_, or\\nchanging like _that_--and it is a guestâ\\x80\\x99s first duty to make himself\\nagreeable to his host, is it not?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was rather glad of\\nSir Thomasâ\\x80\\x99s arrival. As for Matty, she was conscious that Lady\\nFrankland had given her what she would have called â\\x80\\x9ca lookâ\\x80\\x9d before\\nleaving the room, and that her uncle regarded her with a little anxiety\\nas he approached. Decidedly, though she liked talking to Colin, it was\\nnecessary to be less confidential. â\\x80\\x9cI wonâ\\x80\\x99t say _au revoir_,â\\x80\\x9d she said,\\nshrugging her pretty shoulders; â\\x80\\x9cyou know what you said about that once\\nupon a time, when you were a poet.â\\x80\\x9d And then Matty felt a little sorry\\nfor herself as she went away. â\\x80\\x9cThey might know, if they had any sense,\\nthat it does not matter in the least what I say to _him_,â\\x80\\x9d the young\\nlady said to herself; but then she was only suffering the natural\\npenalty of a long course of conquest, and several good matches\\nsacrificed, and matters were serious this time, and not to be trifled\\nwith. Miss Matty accordingly gave up her researches into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s secret;\\nbut not the less regarded with a certain degree of lively despite, the\\nrevelation out of the clouds of that unknown woman at thought of which\\nColin blushed. â\\x80\\x9cI daresay it is somebody quite stupid, who does not\\nunderstand him a bit,â\\x80\\x9d she said to herself, taking a little comfort from\\nthe thought--for Matty Frankland was not a model woman, desiring only\\nthe heroâ\\x80\\x99s happiness; and a man who is sufficiently insensible to\\nconsole himself under such circumstances with another attachment,\\ndeserves to have his inconstancy punished, as everybody will allow.\\n\\nTo tell the truth, Colin, though guiltless of any breach of allegiance\\ntowards Matty, was punished sufficiently for his second attempt at love.\\nHe had heard nothing of Alice all these three years, but,\\nnotwithstanding, had never ceased to feel upon his neck that invisible\\nbridle which restrained him against his will. Perhaps, if the woman of\\nhis imagination had ever fairly revealed herself, the sight would have\\ngiven him courage to break for ever such a visionary bond, and to take\\npossession of his natural liberty; but she contented herself with waving\\nto him those airy salutations out of the clouds, and with now and then\\nthrowing a glance at him out of the eyes of some passer-by, who either\\ndisappeared at once from his sight, or turned out upon examination to be\\nutterly unlike that not impossible She; and Colin had two sentinels to\\nkeep watch upon his honour in the forms of his mother and Lauderdale,\\nboth of whom believed in Love, and did not know what inconstancy meant.\\nHe said to himself often enough that the struggle in his heart was not\\ninconstancy; but then he was not a man who could admit to them, or even\\nto himself, that the bond between him and Alice was a great and tender\\npity, and not love. She had been on the eve of becoming his wife--she\\nmight be his wife still for anything he knew to the contrary--and Colin,\\nwho in this respect was spotless as any Bayard, would not, even to his\\ndearest friends, humiliate by such a confession the woman whose love he\\nhad once sought.\\n\\nAnd now the time had almost come when he could in reality â\\x80\\x9csettle in\\nlife.â\\x80\\x9d His Scotch parish came nearer and nearer, in the natural course\\nof affairs, without any dazzling obstacles and temptations between it\\nand himself, as he had once hoped; and Alice was of age by this time;\\nand honour seemed to demand that, now when his proposal really meant\\nsomething, he should offer to her the possibility of confirming her\\nearly choice. But somehow Colin was not at all anxious to take this\\nstep; he hung back, and nursed the liberty which still remained to him,\\nand longed, in spite of himself, towards the visionary creature of his\\ndreams, who was not Alice. Accordingly, he had two rather troublesome\\nmatters to think over at Wodensbourne, and occupied a position which was\\nmade all the more vexatious because it was at the same time amusing and\\nabsurd. His mind had been made up from the beginning as to his future\\nlife, as he truly said; but then he had quite intended it to be a\\nsacrifice which he made out of his supreme love for his Church and his\\ncountry. He meant to have fought his way back to the venerable mother\\nthrough every sort of brilliant temptation; and to carry his honours to\\nher with a disinterested love which he should prove by leaving behind\\nhim still higher honours and ambitions; whereas, in reality, the world\\nwas permitting him to return very quietly to his native country as if it\\nwas the most natural thing in the world. The disappointment was perhaps\\nharsher in its way than if Colin had meant to avail himself of those\\nsplendid imaginary chances; and it did not make it any the less hard to\\nbear that he himself saw the humour of the situation, and could not but\\nlaugh grimly at himself.\\n\\nPerhaps Colin will suffer in the opinion of the readers of this history\\nwhen we add that, notwithstanding the perplexing and critical character\\nof the conjuncture, and notwithstanding the other complication in his\\nhistory in regard to Alice, he employed his leisure at Wodensbourne,\\nafter the interview we have recorded, in writing[3] verses for Miss\\nMatty. It was true she had challenged him to some such task, but still\\nit was undoubtedly a weakness on the part of a man with so much to think\\nof. Truth, however, compels his historian to confess to this frivolity.\\nAs he strayed about the flat country, and through the park, the leisure\\nin which he had intended to think over his position only betrayed him\\ninto this preposterous idleness; for, to be sure, life generally\\narranges itself in its own way without much help from thinking--but one\\ncannot succeed in writing a farewell to a first love, for which one\\nretains a certain kindness, without a due attention to oneâ\\x80\\x99s rhymes:\\nand this was the sole result, as far as anybody was aware, of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrief but pleasant holiday at Wodensbourne.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV.\\n\\n\\nIt is so difficult a matter to tell the story of a manâ\\x80\\x99s life without\\nwearying the audience, that we will make a leap over all the\\ncircumstances of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s probation in Scotland, though they were\\nsufficiently amusing. For, naturally, the presbytery of Glen-Diarmid--in\\nwhich district the Holy Loch, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s native parish, is situated--were a\\nlittle at a loss what to make of a Fellow of Balliol when he offered\\nhimself for licence. To be sure, they made a long pause over the fact of\\nhis Fellowship, which implied that he was a member of the Church of\\nEngland; but the presbytery permitted Colin to be heard in defence, and\\nhe had friends among them, and had sufficient skill with his weapons to\\nperplex and defeat any rising antagonist. Besides, it was not in the\\nnature of a country presbytery in this tolerant age to be otherwise than\\na little proud of the academical honours which the young neophyte bore.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf we accept any lout who comes up for licence, and refuse a lad of his\\nattainments, what do you suppose the world will think of us?â\\x80\\x9d said one\\nof the more enlightened members of the clerical court, forgetting, as\\nwas natural, that the world concerned itself very little with the doings\\nof the presbytery of Glen-Diarmid. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s safe to leave all that to the\\nobjectors when he comes to be placed,â\\x80\\x9d said another of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s judges,\\nmore wary than his brother; â\\x80\\x9cif heâ\\x80\\x99s not sound, you may trust it to them\\nto find that out,â\\x80\\x9d--and the young man was accordingly endued with the\\npreliminary privileges of preacher, and licensed to exercise his gift.\\nColin had made friends all along the road of his life, as some men are\\nhappy enough to do, and had many who would have been pleased to do him a\\nservice, and one, as it happened, who at this juncture could; and so it\\nbefell, that, a very short time after, the second and more serious trial\\nto which the prudent presbyter had referred, came into the life of the\\nyoung preacher. He was presented, as people say in Scotland, to the\\nparish of Afton, in the county, or, as the natives prefer to call it,\\nthe kingdom of Fife. It was a good living enough, making up, when the\\nharvest was of average productiveness, and wheat steady, rather more\\nthan three hundred pounds a year--and more than that when the harvest\\nwas bad, and the price of com high; and there was an excellent manse,\\nnot much inferior to an English parsonage, and a compact little\\ncomfortable glebe, of which a minister of agricultural tastes might make\\nsomething if he chose; and, above all, there were â\\x80\\x9cheritorsâ\\x80\\x9d of good\\nconditions, and a university town, of small dimensions, but wealthy in\\npoint of society, within reach--all of which points seemed to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nEnglish friends a fabulous combination of advantages to be found in a\\nScotch parish.\\n\\nColin, however, did not fully describe the horrible gulf which lay\\nbetween him and his benefice to anybody out of Scotland; for he was not\\nthe man to betray the imperfections of his beloved country, even while\\nhe suffered from them. His historian, however, does not require to\\nexercise so much delicacy; and, as Colinâ\\x80\\x99s case was exactly the same as\\nthat of any other young clergyman in the Church of Scotland, there is no\\nbetrayal of confidence involved. Between him and that haven there was a\\nchannel to cross before which the boldest might have quailed. The parish\\nof Alton was a large parish, and there were seven hundred and fifty\\npeople in it who had a right to â\\x80\\x9cobjectâ\\x80\\x9d to Colin. They had a right to\\nobject, if they liked, to his looks, or his manners, or his doctrines,\\nor the colour of his hair; they had a right to investigate all his life,\\nand make a complaint at â\\x80\\x9cthe bar of the presbyteryâ\\x80\\x9d--which meant, at the\\nsame time, in all the local newspapers, eager for any kind of\\ngossip--that he had once been guilty of birdâ\\x80\\x99s-nesting, or had heard the\\nmidnight chimes at some unguarded moment of his youth. When Colin\\nentered the pulpit for the first time in the parish to which he was\\npresented, he made his appearance there not to instruct the\\ncongregation, but to be inspected, watched, judged, and finally objected\\nto--and all the process was vigorously enforced in his case. For, to be\\nsure, there were several things to be remarked in this young man--or, as\\nthe people of Afton expressed it, â\\x80\\x9cthis new laudâ\\x80\\x9d--which were out of the\\nway, and unlike other people. He was a lad that had not found Scotch\\neducation good enough for him, but had gone to England for at least part\\nof his training. To be sure, he had partly made up for this by taking\\nthe highest honours possible, and coming out of the contest in a manner\\ncreditable to Scotland--which was a point in his favour. And then his\\nprayers (which was odd, as Colin was decidedly a liturgist) were\\nwanting in those stock expressions which, more pertinacious than any\\nliturgy, haunt the public prayers of the ordinary ministers of the\\nChurch of Scotland; and his sermons were short and innocent of\\ndivisions, and of a tenor totally unlike what the respectable\\nparishioners had been used to hear. Some of the shrewder elders were of\\nopinion that this or that expression â\\x80\\x9cmight mean onythingâ\\x80\\x9d--a conclusion\\nin which there was a certain truth; for Colin, as we have said, was not\\nperfectly clear on all points as to what he believed. If he was not\\naltogether heterodox on the subject of eternal punishment, for example,\\nhe was, to say the least, extremely vague; and, indeed, he deserted\\ndoctrinal ground altogether as often as he could, and took refuge in\\nlife and its necessities in a way which, doubtless, had its effect on\\nthe uninstructed multitude, but was felt to be meagre and unsatisfactory\\nby the theologians of the parish. Two or three public meetings were held\\non the subject before it was time to lodge the final objections against\\nthe â\\x80\\x9cpresentee;â\\x80\\x9d and Colin himself, who was living at St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s, within\\na few miles of the theatre of war, naturally found those meetings, and\\nthe speeches thereat, which appeared in the _Fife Argus_, much less\\namusing than an impartial spectator might have done.\\n\\nAnd then the same enlightened journal contained all sorts of letters on\\nthe subject--letters in which â\\x80\\x9cAn Onlookerâ\\x80\\x9d asked whether the Rev. Mr.\\nCampbell, who was presentee to the parish of Afton, was the same Mr.\\nCampbell who had passed a spring at Rome three or four years before, and\\nhad been noted for his leaning to the Papacy and its superstitious\\nobservances; while, on the other hand, â\\x80\\x9cA Fife Elderâ\\x80\\x9d implored the\\nparishioners to take notice that the man whom an Erastian patron--not\\nhimself a member of the Church, and perhaps unaware how dearly the\\nspiritual privileges purchased by the blood of their martyred\\nforefathers are regarded by Scotsmen--thus endeavoured to force upon\\nthem, was notoriously a disciple of Heward, and belonged to the most\\ninsidious school of modern infidelity. It was the main body of the\\nopposing army which made such attacks; but there was no lack of\\nskirmishers, who treated the subject in a lighter manner, and addressed\\nthe obliging editor in a familiar and playful fashion:--â\\x80\\x9cSir,--Having\\nnothing better to do last Sunday morning, I strayed into the parish\\nchurch of Afton, with the intention of worshipping with the\\ncongregation; but you may judge of my surprise when I observed ascending\\nthe pulpit-stairs a young gentleman presenting all the appearance of a\\nLondon swell or a cavalry officer, with a beard upon which it was\\nevident he had spent more time than on his sermonâ\\x80\\x9d--wrote a witty\\ncorrespondent; while another indignant Scot demanded solemnly, â\\x80\\x9cIs it to\\nbe tolerated that our very pulpits should be invaded by the scum of the\\nEnglish Universities, inexperienced lads that make a hash of the\\nPrayer-book, and preach sermons that may do very well on the other side\\nof the Tweed, but wonâ\\x80\\x99t go down here?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nSuch were the pleasant effusions with which Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend at St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s\\namused his guest at breakfast. They were very amusing to a spectator\\nsafely established in the Elysian fields of a Scotch professorship, and\\nbeyond the reach of objections; but they were not amusing, to speak of,\\nto Colin; and the effect they produced upon the household at Ramore may\\nbe faintly imagined by the general public, as it will be vividly\\nrealized by such Scotch families as have sons in the Church. The\\nMistress had said to herself, with a certain placid thankfulness, â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlittle they can have to say about my Colin, that has been aye the best\\nand the kindest.â\\x80\\x9d But when she saw how much could be made of nothing,\\nthe indignation of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother did not prevent her from being wounded\\nto the heart. â\\x80\\x9cI will never mair believe either in justice or charity,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said, with a thrill of wrath in her voice which had never before\\nbeen heard at Ramore; â\\x80\\x9chim that was aye so true and faithful--him that\\nhas aye served his Master first, and made no account of this world!â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd, indeed, though his motherâ\\x80\\x99s estimation of him might be a little too\\nfavourable, it is certain that few men more entirely devoted to their\\nwork than Colin had ever taken upon them the cure of souls. That,\\nhowever, was a matter beyond the ken of the congregation and parish of\\nAfton. There were seven hundred and fifty communicants, and they had\\nbeen well trained in doctrine under their late minister, and had a high\\ncharacter for intelligence; and, when an opportunity thus happily\\narrived for distinguishing themselves, it was not in human nature to\\nneglect it. Had not West Port worried to the point of extinction three\\nunhappy men whom the Crown itself had successively elevated to the\\nunenviable distinction of presentee? The Afton case now occupied the\\nnewspapers as the West Port case had once occupied them. It combined all\\nthe attractions of a theological controversy and a personal\\ninvestigation; and, indeed, there could have been few better points of\\nview for observing the humours of Scotch character and the peculiarities\\nof rural Scotch society of the humbler levels; only that, as we have\\nbefore said, the process was not so amusing as it might have been to\\nColin and his friends.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMe ken, Mr. Heward?â\\x80\\x9d said the leading weaver of Afton; â\\x80\\x9cno, I ken\\nnothing about him. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no prepared to say what he believes. For that\\nmatter (but this was drawn out by cross-examination), Iâ\\x80\\x99m no just\\nprepared to say at a momentâ\\x80\\x99s notice what I believe myself. I believe in\\nthe Confession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism. No, I cannot just say\\nthat Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever read the Confession of Faith--but eh, man, you ken little\\nabout parish schools if you think I dinna ken the Catechism. Can I say\\nâ\\x80\\x98What is Effectual Calling?â\\x80\\x99 I would like to know what right you have to\\nask me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll say it at a proper time, to them that have a title to ask.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m here to put in my objections against the presentee. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no here to\\nsay my questions. If I was, may be I would ken them better than you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVery well; but I want to understand what you know about Mr. Heward,â\\x80\\x9d\\nsaid the counsel for the defence.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve said already I ken naething about Mr. Heward. Lord bless me! itâ\\x80\\x99s\\nno a man, itâ\\x80\\x99s a principle weâ\\x80\\x99re thinking of. No, I deny that; itâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nan oath. â\\x80\\x98Lord bless me!â\\x80\\x99 is a prayer, if you will be at the bottom oâ\\x80\\x99t.\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ve aâ\\x80\\x99 muckle need to say that. I say the presentee is of the Heward\\nschool of infidelity; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the objection Iâ\\x80\\x99m here to support.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cBut, my friend,â\\x80\\x9d said a member of the presbytery, â\\x80\\x9cit is necessary that\\nyou should be more precise. It is necessary to say, you know, that Mr.\\nHeward rejects revelation; that he----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cModerator, I call my reverend brother to order,â\\x80\\x9d said another minister;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthe witness is here to give evidence about Mr. Campbell. No doubt he is\\nprepared to show us how the presentee has proved himself to belong to\\nthe Heward school.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh ay,â\\x80\\x9d said the witness; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s plenty evidence of that. I took\\nnotes myselâ\\x80\\x99 of aâ\\x80\\x99 the sermons. Hereâ\\x80\\x99s one of them. Itâ\\x80\\x99s maybe a wee in\\nmy ain words, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae change in the sense,--â\\x80\\x98My freends, itâ\\x80\\x99s\\naye best to look after your ain business: itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy to condemn\\nothers. Weâ\\x80\\x99re all the children of the Heavenly Father. I have seen\\ndevotion among a wheen poor uninstructed Papists that would put the best\\nof you to shameâ\\x80\\x99--No, thatâ\\x80\\x99s no what I was looking for; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nlatitudinarian bit.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think it has been said, among other things,â\\x80\\x9d said another member of\\nthe presbytery, â\\x80\\x9cthat Mr. Campbell had a leaning towards papal error; it\\nappears to me that the witnessâ\\x80\\x99s note is almost a proof of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cModerator,â\\x80\\x9d said Colinâ\\x80\\x99s counsel, â\\x80\\x9cI beg to call your attention to the\\nfact that we are not discussing the presenteeâ\\x80\\x99s leaning towards papal\\nerror, but his adherence to the Heward school of infidelity, whatever\\nthat may be. If the witness will inform us, or if any of the members of\\nthe court will inform us, what Mr. Heward believes, we will then be able\\nto make some reply to this part of the case.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI dinna ken naething about Mr. Heward,â\\x80\\x9d said the cautious witness. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno prepared to enter into ony personal question. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no the man but the\\nprinciple that weâ\\x80\\x99re heeding, the rest of the objectors and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe witness is perfectly right,â\\x80\\x9d said a conscientious presbyter; â\\x80\\x9cif we\\nwere tempted to enter into personal questions there would be no end to\\nthe process. My friend, the thing for you to do in this delicate matter\\nis to lead proof. No doubt the presentee has made some statement which\\nhas led you to identify him with Mr. Heward. He has expressed some\\ndoubts, for example, about the origin of Christianity or the truth of\\nrevelation--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOrder, order,â\\x80\\x9d cried the enlightened member; â\\x80\\x9cI protest against such\\nleading questions. Indeed, it appears to me, Moderator, that it is\\nimpossible to proceed with this part of the case unless it has been made\\nclearly apparent to the court what Mr. Heward believes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which there naturally ensued a lively discussion in the presbytery,\\nin which the witness was with difficulty prevented from joining. The\\nsubject was without doubt sufficiently unfathomable to keep half-a-dozen\\npresbyteries occupied; but there were at that period in the kingdom of\\nFife, men of sufficient temerity to pronounce authoritatively even upon\\na matter so mysterious and indefinite. The court, however, adjourned\\nthat day without coming to any decision; and even the Edinburgh papers\\npublished a report of the Afton case, which involved so many important\\ninterests; although so far as concerned the great Heward heresy, the\\nobjections could not be held to be proved.\\n\\nColin was saved on the other counts of his indictment also, as it\\nhappened, but more by accident than by any effect which he produced on\\nhis reluctant parishioners. By dint of repeated examinations on the\\nmodel of that which we have quoted above, the presbytery came to the\\ndecision that the presenteeâ\\x80\\x99s leaning to papal error was, like his\\nadherence to the Heward school of theology, not proven; and they\\neven--for presbyteries also march to a certain extent with the\\nage--declined to consider the milder accusation brought against him, of\\nfavouring the errors of a less fatal heretic. By this time, it is true,\\nColin was on the point of abandoning for ever the Church to which at a\\ndistance he had been willing to give up all his ambitions, and the\\nMistress was wound up to such a pitch of indignant excitement as to\\nthreaten a serious illness, and Lauderdale had publicly demonstrated his\\nwrath by attending â\\x80\\x9cthe English chapel,â\\x80\\x9d as he said, â\\x80\\x9ctwo Sundays\\nrunning.â\\x80\\x9d As for Colin, in the quiet of St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s, feeling like a\\nculprit on his trial, and relishing not at all the notion of being taken\\nto pieces by the papers, even though they were merely papers of Fife, he\\nhad begun to regard with some relief the idea of going back to Balliol\\nand reposing on his Fellowship, and even taking pupils, if nothing\\nbetter came in his way. If he could have gone into Parliament, as Matty\\nFrankland suggested, the indignant young man would have seized violently\\non that means of exposing to the House and the world the miseries of a\\nScotch presentee and the horrors of Lord Aberdeenâ\\x80\\x99s Act. But,\\nfortunately, he had no means of getting into Parliament, and a certain\\nsense at the bottom of his heart, that this priesthood which had to be\\nentered by a channel so painful and humiliating was in reality his true\\nvocation, retained him as by a silken thread. If he had been less\\nconvinced on this point, no doubt he would have abandoned the mortifying\\nstruggle, and the parish of Afton, having whetted its appetite upon him,\\nwould have gone freshly to work upon another unhappy young preacher, and\\ncrunched his bones with equal satisfaction; and, what is still more\\nimportant to us, this history would have broken off abruptly short of\\nits fit and necessary period. None of those misfortunes happened,\\nbecause Colin had at heart a determination to make himself heard, and\\nenter upon his natural vocation, and because, in the second place, he\\nwas independent, and did not at the present moment concern himself in\\nthe smallest degree about the stipend of the parish, whether corn was at\\nfive pounds the chaldron or five shillings. To be sure, it is contrary\\nto the ordinary habit of biography to represent a young clergyman as\\nentering a parish against the will or with the dislike of the\\ninhabitants; as a general rule it is at worst, an interested curiosity,\\nif not a lively enthusiasm, which the young parish priests of literature\\nfind in their village churches; but then it is not England or Arcadia of\\nwhich we are writing, nor of an ideal curate or spotless primitive\\nvicar, but only of Colin Campbell and the parish of Afton, in the\\nkingdom of Fife, in the country of Scotland, under the beneficent\\noperation of Lord Aberdeenâ\\x80\\x99s Act.\\n\\nHowever, at last the undignified combat terminated. After the objections\\nwere all disposed of, the seven hundred and fifty communicants received\\ntheir minister, it is to be hoped, with the respect due to a victor.\\nPerhaps it was a touch of disdain on Colinâ\\x80\\x99s part--proving how faulty\\nthe young man remained, notwithstanding, as the Mistress said, â\\x80\\x9call he\\nhad come throughâ\\x80\\x9d--that prompted him to ascend the pulpit, after the\\nstruggle was over, with his scarlet hood glaring on his black gown to\\nthe consternation of his parishioners. It cannot be denied that this\\nlittle movement of despite was an action somewhat unworthy of Colin at\\nsuch a moment and in such a place; but then he was young, and it is\\ndifficult for a young man to do under all circumstances exactly what he\\nought. When he had got there and opened his mouth, Colin forgot all\\nabout his scarlet hood--he forgot they had all objected to him and put\\nhim in the papers. He saw only before him a certain corner of the world\\nin which he had to perform the highest office that is confided to man.\\nHe preached without thinking he was preaching, forgetting all about\\ndoctrines, and only remembering the wonderful bewildering life in which\\nevery soul before him had its share, the human mysteries and agonies,\\nthe heaven, so vague and distant, the need so urgent and so near. In\\nsight of these, which had nothing to do with Lord Aberdeenâ\\x80\\x99s Act, Colin\\nforgot that he had been put innocently on his trial, and taken to\\npieces; and, what was still more strange, when two or three harmless\\nweeks had passed, the seven hundred and fifty communicants had clean\\nforgotten it too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI.\\n\\n\\nBut, after all, there are few trials to which a man of lofty intentions\\nand an elevated ideal can be exposed, more severe than the entirely\\nunexpected one which comes upon him when he has had his way, and finds\\nhimself for the first time in the much desired position in which he can\\ncarry out all the plans of his youth. Perhaps few people arrive so\\ncompletely at this point as to acknowledge it distinctly to themselves;\\nfor, to be sure, human projects and devices have a knack of expanding\\nand undergoing a gradual change from moment to moment. Something of the\\nkind, however, must accompany, for example, every happy marriage; though\\nperhaps it is the woman more than the man who comes under its influence.\\nThe beautiful new world of love and goodness into which the happy bride\\nsupposes herself to be entering comes to bear after a while so\\nextraordinary a resemblance to the ordinary mediocre world which she has\\nquitted that the young woman stands aghast and bewildered. The happiness\\nwhich has come has made a more subtle happiness, that ideal perfection\\nof being to which she has been more or less looking forward all her\\nlife. Colin, when he had gone through all his trials, and had fairly\\nreached the point at which the heroic and magnificent existence which he\\nmeant to live should commence, found himself very much in the same\\nposition. The young man was still in the fantastic age. To preach his\\nsermons every Sunday, and do his necessary duty, and take advantage of\\nthe good society at St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s, did not seem a life sufficient for the\\nnew minister. What he had thought of was something impossible, a work\\nfor his country, an elevation of the national firmament, an influence\\nwhich should mellow the rude goodness of Scotland, and link her again to\\nall the solemn past, to all the good and gracious present, to all the\\ntender lights and dawns of hope.\\n\\nColin had derived from all the religious influences with which he had\\nbeen brought in contact a character which was perhaps only possible to a\\nyoung Scotchman and Presbyterian, strongly anchored to his hereditary\\ncreed, and yet feeling all its practical deficiencies. He was High\\nChurch, though he smiled at Apostolic succession; he was Catholic,\\nthough the most gorgeous High Mass that ever was celebrated would have\\nmoved him no more than one of Verdiâ\\x80\\x99s operas. When other enlightened\\nBritish spectators regarded with lofty superiority the poor Papist\\npeople coming and going into all the tawdry little churches, and singing\\nunintelligible Latin, horribly out of tune, Colin for his part looked at\\nthem with a sigh for his own country, which had ceased to recognise any\\ngood in such devotion. And all through his education, from the moment\\nwhen he smiled at the prayer-book under the curateâ\\x80\\x99s arm at\\nWodensbourne, and wondered what a Scotch peasant would think of it, to\\nthe time when he studied in the same light the prelections of the\\nUniversity preacher in St. Maryâ\\x80\\x99s, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s thought had been, â\\x80\\x9cWould I\\nwere in the field!â\\x80\\x9d It appeared to him that if he were but there, in all\\nhis profusion of strength and youth, he could breathe a new breath into\\nthe country he loved. What he meant to do was to untie the horrible\\nbands of logic and knit fair links of devotion around that corner of the\\nuniverse which it has always seemed possible to Scotsmen to make into a\\nUtopia; to persuade his nation to join hands again with Christendom, to\\ntake back again the festivals and memories of Christianity, to rejoice\\nin Christmas and sing lauds at Easter, and say common prayers with a\\nuniversal voice. These were to be the outward signs; but the fact was\\nthat it was a religious revolution in Scotland at which Colin aimed. He\\nmeant to dethrone the pragmatic and arrogant preacher, whose reign has\\nlasted so long. He meant to introduce a more humble self-estimate, and a\\nmore gracious temper into the world he swayed in imagination. From this\\ndream Colin woke up, after the rude experience of the objectors, to find\\nhimself at the head of his seven hundred and fifty communicants, with\\nauthority to say anything he liked to them (always limited by the\\nknowledge that they might at any time â\\x80\\x9clibelâ\\x80\\x9d him before the presbytery,\\nand that the presbytery might at any time prosecute, judge, and condemn\\nhim), and to a certain extent spiritual ruler of the parish, with a\\nright to do anything he liked in it, always subject to the approval of\\nthe Kirk-Session, which could contravent him in many ingenious ways. The\\nyoung man was at last in the position to which he had looked forward for\\nyears--at last his career was begun, and the course of his ambition lay\\nclear before him. Nothing now remained but to realize all these\\nmagnificent projects, and carry out his dreams.\\n\\nBut the fact is that Colin, instead of plunging into his great work,\\nstood on the threshold struck dumb and bewildered, much as a bride might\\ndo on the threshold of the new home which she had looked forward to as\\nsomething superior to Paradise. The position of his dreams was obtained,\\nbut these dreams had never till now seemed actually hopeless and\\npreposterous. When he took his place up aloft in his high pulpit, from\\nwhich he regarded his people much as a man at a first-floor window might\\nregard the passers-by below, and watched the ruddy countrymen pouring in\\nwith their hats on their heads and a noise like thunder, the first\\nterrible blow was struck at his palace of fancy. They were altogether\\ndifferent from the gaping rustics at Wodensbourne, to whom that good\\nlittle curate preached harmless sermons out of his low desk, about the\\ntwenty-first Sunday after Trinity, and the admirable arrangements of the\\nChurch. Colin upstairs at his first-floor window was in no harmless\\nposition. He was put up there for a certain business, which the\\naudience down below understood as well as he did. As for prayers and\\npsalm-singing, they were necessary preliminaries to be got over as\\nquickly as possible. The congregation listened and made internal\\ncriticisms as the young minister said his prayers. â\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 limited\\nin his confessions,â\\x80\\x9d one of the elders whispered to another. â\\x80\\x9cI canna\\nthink heâ\\x80\\x99s fathomed the nature oâ\\x80\\x99 sin, for my part;â\\x80\\x9d and Colin was\\nconscious by something in the atmosphere, by a certain hum and stir,\\nthat, though his people were a little grateful to find his first attempt\\nat devotion shorter than usual, a second call upon them was regarded\\nwith a certain displeased surprise; for, to be sure, the late minister\\nof Afton had been of the old school. And then, this inevitable preface\\nhaving been disposed of, the congregation settled down quietly to the\\nbusiness of the day. Colin was young, and had kept his youthful awe of\\nthe great mysteries of faith, though he was a minister. It struck him\\nwith a sort of panic, when he looked down upon all those attentive\\nfaces, and recalled to himself the idea that he was expected to teach\\nthem, to throw new light upon all manner of doctrines, and open up the\\nBible, and add additional surety to the assurance already possessed by\\nthe audience that it was a very well-instructed congregation and knew\\nall about the system of Christian theology. It gleamed upon Colin in\\nthat terrible moment that, instead of being a predestined reformer, he\\nwas a very poor pretender indeed, and totally inadequate to the duties\\nof the post which he had taken upon him thus rashly; for, indeed, he was\\nnot by any means so clear as most of his hearers were about the system\\nof theology. This sudden sense of incapacity, which came upon him at the\\nvery moment when he ought to have been strongest, was a terrible waking\\nup for Colin. He preached his sermon--but with pale lips and a heart out\\nof which all the courage seemed to have died for the moment; and betook\\nhimself to his manse afterwards to think it all over, with a horrible\\nsense that, after all, he was a sham and impostor, and utterly unworthy\\nof exercising influence upon any reasonable creature. For, to be sure,\\nthough a lofty ideal is the best thing in the world, according to its\\nelevation is the pain and misery of the fall.\\n\\nThe consequence was that Colin stopped short in a kind of fright after\\nhe had made this first discovery, and that, after all his great\\nprojects, nothing in the world was heard all that winter of the young\\nreformer. To return to our metaphor, he was silent as a young wife\\nsometimes finds herself among the relics of her absurd youthful\\nfancies, contemplating the ruin ruefully, and not yet fully awakened to\\nthe real possibilities of the position. During this little interval he\\ncame gradually down out of his too lofty ideas to consider the actual\\ncircumstances. When Lauderdale came to see him, which he did on the\\noccasion of the national new-year holiday, Colin took his friend to see\\nhis church with a certain comic despair. â\\x80\\x9cI have a finer chancel than\\nthat at Wodensbourne, which was the curateâ\\x80\\x99s object in life,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nColin; â\\x80\\x9cbut, if I make any fuss about it, I should be set down as an\\nidiot; and, if any man has an imagination sufficiently lively to\\nconceive of my ploughmen entering my church as our poor friends went\\ninto the Pantheon----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDinna be unreasonable,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cYou were aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fantastic\\nin your notions; what should the honest men ken about a chancel? I\\nwouldna say that Iâ\\x80\\x99m just clear on the subject myselâ\\x80\\x99. As for the\\nPantheon, that was aye an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 delusion on your part. Our cathedral at\\nGlasgow is an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal mair Christian-like than the Pantheon, as far\\nas I can judge; but I wouldna say that itâ\\x80\\x99s an idea that ever enters my\\nhead to go there for my ain hand to say my prayers; and, as for a\\ncountry kirk with naked pews and cauld stone----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook at it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin with an air of disgust which was comprehensible\\nenough in a Fellow of Balliol. The church of Afton was worth looking at.\\nIt illustrated with the most wonderful, almost comic, exactness, two\\ndistinct historic periods. At one end of it was a wonderful Norman\\nchancel, gloomy but magnificent, with its heavy and solemn arches almost\\nas perfect as when they were completed. This chancel had been united to\\na church of later date (long since demolished) by a lighter and loftier\\npointed arch, which, however, under Colinâ\\x80\\x99s incumbency, was filled up\\nwith a partition of wood, in which there was a little door giving\\nadmission to the church proper, the native and modern expression of\\necclesiastical necessities in Scotland. This edifice was like nothing so\\nmuch as a square box, encircled by a level row of windows high up in the\\nwall, so many on each side; and there it was that Colinâ\\x80\\x99s lofty pulpit,\\nup two pairs of stairs, rigidly and nakedly surveyed the rigorous lines\\nof naked pews which traversed the unlovely area. Colin regarded this\\nscene of his labours with a disgust so melancholy, yet so comical, that\\nhis companion, though not much given to mirth, gave forth a laugh which\\nrang into the amazed and sombre echoes. â\\x80\\x9cYes, it is easy enough to\\nlaugh,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who was not without a sense of the comic side of his\\nposition; â\\x80\\x9cbut if it was your own church----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhisht, callant,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, whose amusement was momentary; â\\x80\\x9cif I\\nhad ever come to onything in this world, and had a kirk, I wouldna have\\nbeen so fanciful. Itâ\\x80\\x99s well for you to get your lesson written out so\\nplain. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae place to speak of here for the prayers and the\\nthanksgivings. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no saying but what they are the best, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nour manner of regarding things in Scotland. Even the man that has maist\\nset his heart on a revolution must aye begin with things as they are.\\nThis is no a place open at aâ\\x80\\x99 times to every man that has a word to say\\nto God in quietness, like yon Catholic chapels. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a place for\\npreaching; and you maun preach.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPreach!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cwhat am I to preach? What I have learned here and\\nthere, in Dickopftenburg for example, or in the Divinity Hall? and much\\nthe better they would be for all that. Besides, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe in\\npreaching, Lauderdale. Preaching never did me the least service. As for\\nthat beastly pulpit perched up there, all wood and noise as it is----â\\x80\\x9d\\nbut here Colin paused, overcome by the weight of his discontent, and the\\ngiddiness natural to his terrible fall.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWell,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, after a pause, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no saying but what thereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsome justice in what you say; but I would like to hear, with your ideas,\\nwhat youâ\\x80\\x99re meaning to do.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nTo which Colin answered with a groan. â\\x80\\x9cPreach,â\\x80\\x9d he said gloomily; â\\x80\\x9cthere\\nis nothing else I can do: preach them to death, I suppose: preach about\\neverything in heaven and earth; it is all a priest is good for here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cand then the worst oâ\\x80\\x99t is that youâ\\x80\\x99re no a\\npriest, but only a minister. I wouldna say, however, but what you might\\npluck up a heart and go into the singing business, and maybe have a\\nprocess in the presbytery about an organ; thatâ\\x80\\x99s the form that\\nreformation takes in our kirk, especially with young ministers that have\\ntravelled and cultivated their minds, like you. But, Colin,â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nphilosopher, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99ve been in more places than the Divinity Hall. There\\nwas once a time when you were awfuâ\\x80\\x99 near dying, if a man daur say the\\ntruth now itâ\\x80\\x99s past; and there was once a bit little chamâ\\x80\\x99er out yonder,\\nbetween heaven and earth----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOut yonder--Lauderdale gave a little jerk with his hand, as he stood at\\nthe open door, across the grey, level country which lay between the\\nparish church of Afton and the sea; and the words and the gesture\\nconveyed Colin suddenly to the lighted window that shone feebly over the\\nCampagna, and to the talk within over Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s deathbed. The\\nrecollection brought a wonderful change over his thoughts. He took his\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s arm in silence, when he had locked the door. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder what he\\nis doing,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI wonder whether the reality has fallen short of\\nthe expectation there. If there should be no golden gates or shining\\nstreets as yet, but only another kind of life with other hopes and\\ntrials! If one could but know!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, in the tone that Colin knew so well; and then\\nthere was a long pause. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no saying but what itâ\\x80\\x99s natural,â\\x80\\x9d he went\\non afterwards with some vagueness. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s aye awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard upon a man to\\nget his ain way; but once in a while thereâ\\x80\\x99s one arises that can take\\nthe good out of even that. Youâ\\x80\\x99ll no make Scotland of your way of\\nthinking, Colin; but youâ\\x80\\x99ll make it worth her while to have brought ye\\nforth for aâ\\x80\\x99 that. As for Arthur, poor callant, I wouldna say but his\\nideal may have changed a wee on the road there. Iâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 indifferent to\\nthe shining streets for my part; but Iâ\\x80\\x99m no indifferent to them that\\nbide yonder in the silence. There was one now that wasna in your case,â\\x80\\x9d\\ncontinued Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9c_he_ was aye pleased to teach in season and out\\nof season. For the sake of the like of him, Iâ\\x80\\x99m whiles moved to hope\\nthat aâ\\x80\\x99s no so awfuâ\\x80\\x99 perfect in the other world as we think. I canna see\\nony ground for it in the Bible. Naething ever comes to an end in this\\nworld, callant;--and that was just what I was meaning to ask in respect\\nto other things.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you mean by other things,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cthat is, if\\nyou mean Miss Meredith, Lauderdale, I have heard nothing of her for\\nyears. That must be concluded to have come to an end if anything ever\\ndid. It is not for me to subject myself to rejection any more.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nUpon which Lauderdale breathed out a long breath which sounded like a\\nsigh, and was visible as well as audible in the frosty air. â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s aye\\nweel to have your lesson written so plain,â\\x80\\x9d he said after a minute, with\\nthat want of apparent sequence which was sometimes amusing and sometimes\\nirritating to Colin; â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s nae disgrace to a man to do his work under\\nstrange conditions. When a lad like you has no place to work in but a\\npulpit, itâ\\x80\\x99s clear to me that God intends him to preach whether he likes\\nit or no.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd this was all the comfort Colin received, in the midst of his\\ndisenchantment and discouragement, from his dearest friend.\\n\\nBut before the winter was over, life had naturally asserted its rights\\nin the mind of the young minister. He had begun to stretch out his hands\\nfor his tools almost without knowing it, and to find that after all, a\\nman in a pulpit, although he has two flights of stairs to ascend to it,\\nhas a certain power in his hand. Colin found eventually, that he had\\nafter all a great deal to say, and that even in one hour in a week it\\nwas possible to convey sundry new ideas into the rude, but not stupid,\\nminds of his parishioners. A great many of them had that impracticable\\nand hopeless amount of intelligence natural to a well brought-up Scotch\\npeasant, with opinions upon theological matters and a lofty estimate of\\nhis own powers; but withal there were many minds open and thoughtful as\\nsilence, and the fields, and much observation of the operations of\\nnature could make them. True, there were all the disadvantages to be\\nencountered in Afton which usually exist in Scotch parishes of the\\npresent generation. There was a Free church at the other end of the\\nparish very well filled, and served by a minister who was much more\\nclear in a doctrinal point of view than Colin; and the heritors, for the\\nmost part--that is to say, the land-owners of the parish--though they\\nwere pleased to ask a Fellow of Balliol to dinner, and to show him a\\ngreat deal of attention, yet drove placidly past his church every Sunday\\nto the English chapel in St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s; which is unhappily the general\\nfortune of the National Church in Scotland. It was on this divided world\\nthat Colin looked from his high pulpit, where, at least for his hour, he\\nhad the privilege of saying what he pleased without any contradiction;\\nand it is not to be denied that after a while the kingdom of Fife grew\\nconscious to its other extremity that in the eastern corner a man had\\narrived who had undoubtedly something to say. As his popularity began to\\nrise, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ambitions crept back to his heart one by one. He preached\\nthe strangest sort of baffling, unorthodox sermons, in which, however,\\nwhen an adverse critic took notes, there was found to be nothing upon\\nwhich in these days he could be brought to the bar of the presbytery.\\nThirty years ago, indeed, matters were otherwise regulated; but even\\npresbyteries have this advantage over popes, that they do take a step\\nforward occasionally to keep in time with their age.\\n\\nThis would be the proper point at which to leave Colin, if there did not\\nexist certain natural, human prejudices on the subject which require a\\ndistinct conclusion of one kind or another. Until a man is dead, it is\\nimpossible to say what he has done, or to make any real estimate of his\\nwork; and Colin, so far from being dead, is only as yet at the\\ncommencement of his career, having taken the first steps with some\\nsuccess and _Ã©clat_, and having recovered the greater part of his\\nenthusiasm. There was, indeed, a time when his friends expected nothing\\nelse for him than that early and lovely ending which makes a biography\\nperfect. There is only one other ending in life, which is equally\\nsatisfactory, and, at least on the face of it, more cheerful than dying;\\nand that, we need not say, is marriage. Accordingly, as it is impossible\\nto pursue his course to the one end, all that we can do is to turn to\\nthe other, which, though the hero himself was not aware of it, was at\\nthat moment shadowing slowly out of the morning clouds.\\n\\nIt is accordingly with a feeling of relief that we turn from the little\\necclesiastical world of Scotland, where we dare not put ourselves in too\\nrigorous contact with reality, or reveal indiscreetly, without regard to\\nthe sanctity of individual confidence, what Colin is doing, to the\\ncommon open air and daylight, in which he set out, all innocent and\\nunfearing, on a summer morning, accompanied as of old by Lauderdale,\\nupon a holiday journey. He had not the remotest idea, any more than the\\nreaders of his history have at this moment, what was to happen to him\\nbefore he came back again. He set out with all his revolutionary ideas\\nin his mind, without pausing to think that circumstances might occur\\nwhich would soften down all insurrectionary impulses on his part, and\\npresent him to the alarmed Church, not under the aspect of an\\nirresistible agitator and reformer, but in the subdued character of a\\nman who has given hostages to society. Colin had no thought of this\\ndownfall in his imagination when he set out. He had even amused himself\\nwith the idea of a new series of â\\x80\\x9cTracts for the Times,â\\x80\\x9d which might\\nperadventure work as much commotion in the Church of Scotland as the\\nformer series had done in the Anglican communion. He went off in full\\nforce and energy with the draft of the first of these revolutionary\\ndocuments in the writing-case in which he had once copied out his verses\\nfor Alice Meredith. Poor Alice Meredith! The bridle which Colin had once\\nfelt on his neck had worn by this time to such an impalpable thread that\\nhe was no longer aware of its existence; and even the woman in the\\nclouds had passed out of his recollection for the moment, so much was he\\nabsorbed with the great work he had embarked on. Thus he set out on a\\npedestrian excursion, meaning to go to the English lakes, and it is hard\\nto say where besides, in his monthâ\\x80\\x99s holiday; and nothing in the air or\\nin the skies gave any notice to Colin of the great event that was to\\nbefall him before he could return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII.\\n\\n\\nIt was, as we have said, a lovely summer morning when Colin set out on\\nhis excursion, after the fatigues of the winter and spring. His first\\nstage was naturally Ramore, where he arrived the same evening, having\\npicked up Lauderdale at Glasgow on his way. A more beautiful evening had\\nnever shone over the Holy Loch; and, as the two friends approached\\nRamore, all the western sky was flaming behind the dark hills, which\\nstood up in austere shadow, shutting out from the loch and its immediate\\nbanks the later glories of the sunset. To leave the eastern shore, where\\nthe light still lingered, and steal up under the shadow into the soft\\nbeginning of the twilight, with Ramore, that â\\x80\\x9cshines where it stands,â\\x80\\x9d\\nlooking out hospitably from the brae, was like leaving the world of\\nnoise and commotion for the primitive life, with its silence and its\\nthoughts; and so, indeed, Colin felt it, though his world was but\\nanother country parish, primitive enough in its ways. But then it must\\nnot be forgotten that there is a difference between the kingdom of Fife,\\nwhere wheat grows golden on the broad fields, and where the herrings\\ncome up to the shore to be salted and packed in barrels, and the sweet\\nLoch half hidden among the hills, where the cornfields are scant and\\nfew, and where grouse and heather divide the country with the beasts and\\nthe pastures, and where, in short, Gaelic was spoken within the memory\\nof man. Perhaps there was something of the vanity of youth in that look\\nof observation and half amused, half curious criticism which the young\\nman cast upon the peaceful manse, where it did not seem as if anything\\ncould ever happen, and where the minister, who had red hair, had\\npainfully begun his career when Colin himself was a boy. The manse of\\nAfton was not nearly so lovely, but--it was different; though perhaps he\\ncould not have told how. And the same thought was in his mind as he went\\non past all the tranquil houses. How did they manage to keep existing,\\nthose people for whom life was over, who had ceased to look beyond the\\nday, or to anticipate either good or evil? To be sure all this was very\\nunreasonable; for Colin was aware that things did happen now and then on\\nthe Holy Loch. Somebody died occasionally, when it was impossible to\\nhelp it, and by turns somebody was born, and there even occurred, at\\nrare intervals a marriage, with its suggestion of life beginning; but\\nthese domestic incidents were not what he was thinking of. Life seemed\\nto be in its quiet evening over all that twilight coast; and then it was\\nthe morning with Colin, and it did not seem possible for him to exist\\nwithout the hopes, and motives, and excitements which made ceaseless\\nmovement and commotion in his soul. He was so full of what had to be\\ndone, even of what he himself had to do, that the silence seemed to\\nrecede before him, and to rustle and murmur round him as he carried into\\nit his conscious and restless life.\\n\\nColin had even such a wealth of existence to dispose of that it kept\\nflowing on in two or three distinct channels, a thing which amused him\\nwhen he thought of it. For underneath all this sense of contrast, and\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s talk, and his own watch for the Ramore boat, No. 1 of the\\nâ\\x80\\x9cTracts for the Timesâ\\x80\\x9d was at the same time shaping itself in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nbrain; and there are moments when a man can stand apart from himself,\\nand note what is going on in his own mind. He was greeting the old\\nfriends who recognised him in the steamboat, and looking out for home,\\nand planning his tract, and making that contrast between the evening and\\nthe morning all at the same moment. And at the same time he had taken\\noff the front of his mental habitation, and was looking at all those\\ndifferent processes going on in its different compartments with a\\ncurious sense of amusement. Such were the occupations of his mind as he\\nwent up to the Loch, to that spot where the Ramore boat lay waiting on\\nthe rippled surface. It was a different homecoming from any that he had\\never made before. Formerly his prospects were vague, and it never was\\nquite certain what he might make of himself. Now he had fulfilled all\\nthe ambitions of his family, as far as his position went. There was\\nnothing more to hope for or to desire in that particular; and,\\nnaturally, Colin felt that his influence with his father and brothers at\\nleast would be enhanced by the realization of those hopes, which, up to\\nthis time, had always been mingled with a little uncertainty. He forgot\\nall about that, it is true, when he grasped the hands of Archie and of\\nthe farmer, and dashed up the brae to where the Mistress stood wistful\\nat the door; but, notwithstanding, there was a difference, and it was\\none which was sufficiently apparent to all. As for his mother, she\\nsmoothed down the sleeve of his black coat with her kind hand, and\\nexamined with a tender smile the cut of the waistcoat which Colin had\\nbrought from Oxford--though, to tell the truth, he had still a stolen\\ninclination for â\\x80\\x9cmufti,â\\x80\\x9d and wore his uniform only when a solemn\\noccasion occurred like this and on grand parade; but, for all her joy\\nand satisfaction at sight of him, the Mistress still looked a little\\nshattered and broken, and had never forgotten--though Colin had\\nforgotten it long ago--the â\\x80\\x9cobjectionsâ\\x80\\x9d of the parish of Afton, and all\\nthat her son had had â\\x80\\x9cto come through,â\\x80\\x9d as she said, â\\x80\\x9cbefore he was\\nplaced.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 shaken in my mind about aâ\\x80\\x99 that,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s\\nthe Free Kirk folk--though Iâ\\x80\\x99m no for making an example of\\nthem--fighting among themselves about their new minister, like thae puir\\nsenseless creatures in America. Thamas, at the Millhead, is for the ae\\ncandidate, and his brother Dugald for the tither; and theyâ\\x80\\x99re like to\\ntear each otherâ\\x80\\x99s een out when they meet. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s ill enough, but Aftonâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwaur. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no for setting up priests, nor making them a sacerdotal caste\\nas some folk say; but will you tell me,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell,\\nindignantly, â\\x80\\x9cthat a wheen ignorant weavers and canailye like that can\\njudge my Colin? ay, or even if it was thae Fife farmers driving in their\\ngigs. I would like to ken what he studied for and took aâ\\x80\\x99 thae honours,\\nand gave baith time and siller, if he wasna to ken better than the like\\nof them? Iâ\\x80\\x99m no pretending to meddle with politics that are out of my\\nway--but I canna shut my een,â\\x80\\x9d the Mistress said, emphatically. â\\x80\\x9cThe\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 thing is that weâ\\x80\\x99ve nae respect to speak of for onything but\\nourselves; weâ\\x80\\x99re so awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fond of our ain bit poor opinions, and the\\nlittle we ken. If there was ony change in our parish--and the ministerâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfar from weel, by aâ\\x80\\x99 I can hear--and that man round the point at the\\nEnglish chapel wasna such an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 haveril--I would be tempted to flee\\naway out of their fechts and their objections, and get a quiet Sabbath\\nday there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no for buying peace so dear, for my part,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale;\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctheyâ\\x80\\x99re terrible haverils, most of the English ministers in our pairts,\\nas the Mistress says. Weâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 in a kind of dissenting way now-a-days,\\nthe mairâ\\x80\\x99s the pity. Whisht a moment, callant, and let a man speak.--Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\nno saying onything against dissent; itâ\\x80\\x99s a wee hard in its ways, and it\\nhas an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 opinion of itselâ\\x80\\x99, and thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae beauty in it; but, when\\nyour mindâ\\x80\\x99s made up to have popular rights and your ain way in\\neverything, I canna see onything else for it, for my part.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeel, weâ\\x80\\x99ll aâ\\x80\\x99 see,â\\x80\\x9d said big Colin, who in his heart could not defend\\nan order of ecclesiastical economy which permitted his son to be\\nassaulted by the parish of Afton, or any other parish, â\\x80\\x9cif itâ\\x80\\x99s the\\nwill of God. Weâ\\x80\\x99re none of us so awfuâ\\x80\\x99 auld; but the worldâ\\x80\\x99s aye near\\nits ending to a woman that sees her son slighted; thereâ\\x80\\x99s nae penitence\\ncan make up for that--no that heâ\\x80\\x99s suffered much that I can see,â\\x80\\x9d the\\nfarmer said with a laugh. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s enough of the Kirk for one night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, dinna be so worldly,â\\x80\\x9d said his wife; â\\x80\\x9cI think whiles it\\nwould be an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 blessing if the world was to end as you say; and a\\nthing be cleared up, and them joined again that had been parted, and the\\nbonnie earth safe through the fire--if itâ\\x80\\x99s to be by fire,â\\x80\\x9d she added\\nwith a questioning glance towards her son; â\\x80\\x9cI canna think but itâ\\x80\\x99s ower\\ngood to be true. When I mind upon aâ\\x80\\x99 weâ\\x80\\x99ve to go through in this life,\\nand aâ\\x80\\x99 that is so hard to mend;--eh, if He would but take it in His ain\\nhand!â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress with tears in her eyes. No one was so\\nhard-hearted as to preach to her at that moment, or to enlarge upon the\\nfact that everything was in His hand, as indeed she knew as well as her\\ncompanions; but it happens sometimes that the prayers and the wishes\\nwhich are out of reason, are those that come warmest, and touch deepest,\\nto the heart.\\n\\nBut, meanwhile, awaiting the end of the world, Colin, when he was\\nsettled for the night in his old room, with its shelving roof, took out\\nand elaborated his _Tract for the Times_. It was discontent as great as\\nthat of his motherâ\\x80\\x99s which breathed out of it; but then hers was the\\ndiscontent of a life which had nothing to do or to look for, and which\\nhad found out by experience how little progress can be made in a\\nlifetime, and how difficult it is to change evil into good. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndiscontent, on the contrary, was that exhilarating sentiment which\\nstimulates youth, and opens an endless field of combat and conquest. At\\nhis end of the road it looked only natural that the obstacles should\\nmove of themselves out of the way, and that what was just and best\\nshould have the inevitable victory. When he had done, he thought with a\\ntenderness which brought tears to his eyes, yet at the same moment a\\nsmile to his lips, of the womanâ\\x80\\x99s impatience that would hasten the\\nwheels of fate, and call upon God to take matters, as she said, in His\\nown hand. That did not, as yet, seem a step necessary to Colin. He\\nthought there was still time to work by the natural means, and that\\nthings were not arrived as such a pass that it was needful to appeal to\\nmiracle. It could only be when human means had failed that such a\\nresource could be necessary; and the human means had certainly not\\nfailed entirely so long as he stood there in the bloom of his young\\nstrength, with his weapons in his hand.\\n\\nHe preached in his native church on the following Sunday, as was to be\\nexpected; and from up the Loch and down the Loch all the world came to\\nhear young Colin of Ramore. And big Colin the farmer sat glorious at the\\nend of his pew, and in the pride of his heart listened, and noted, and\\nmade inexorable criticisms, and commented on his sonâ\\x80\\x99s novel ideas with\\na severe irony which it was difficult to understand in its true sense.\\nThe Duke himself came to hear Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sermon, which was a wonderful\\nhonour to the young man, and all the parish criticised him with a zest\\nwhich it was exhilarating to hear. â\\x80\\x9cI mind when he couldna say his\\nQuestions,â\\x80\\x9d said Evan of Barnton; â\\x80\\x9cI wouldna like to come under ony\\nengagement that he kens them noo. He was aye a callant awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fond of his\\nain opinion, and for my part Iâ\\x80\\x99m no for Presbyteries passing ower\\nobjections so easy. Either heâ\\x80\\x99s of Hewardâ\\x80\\x99s school or heâ\\x80\\x99s no; but I\\nnever saw that there was ony right decision come to. There were some\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 suspicious expressions under his second head--if you could caâ\\x80\\x99 yon\\na head,â\\x80\\x9d said the spiritual ruler, with natural contempt; for indeed\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s divisions were not what they ought to have been, and he was\\nperfectly open to criticism so far as that was concerned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cA lot of that was out of Dennistoun,â\\x80\\x9d said another thoughtful\\nspectator. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m aye doubtful of thae misty phrases. If it wasna for\\nhurting aâ\\x80\\x99 their feelings, I would be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 tempted to say a word. Heâ\\x80\\x99s\\nnoâ\\x80\\x99 that auld, and he might mend.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHeâ\\x80\\x99ll never mend,â\\x80\\x9d said Evan. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m noâ\\x80\\x99 one that ever approved of the\\nupbringing of thae laddies. They have ower much opinion of themselves.\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s Archie, that thinks he kens the price of cattle better than a\\nman of twice his age. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 fanciful woman, that mother of\\ntheirs--and then theyâ\\x80\\x99ve aâ\\x80\\x99 been a wee spoiled with that business about\\nthe English callant; but Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no say but what he has abilities,â\\x80\\x9d the\\ncritic added, with a national sense of clanship. The parish might not\\napprove of the upbringing of the young Campbells, nor of their opinions,\\nbut still it had a national share in any reputation that the family or\\nany of its members might attain.\\n\\nColin continued his course on the Monday with his friend. He had stayed\\nbut a few days at home, but it was enough, and all the party were\\nsensible of the fact. Henceforward that home, precious as it was, could\\nnot count for much in his life. It was a hard thing to think of, but it\\nwas a necessity of nature. Archie and the younger sons greeted with\\nenthusiasm the elder brother, who shared with them his better fortunes\\nand higher place; but, when the greeting was given on both sides, there\\ndid not remain very much to say; for, to be sure, seen by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s side,\\nthe young Campbells,--still _gauche_, and shamefaced, and with the pride\\nof a Scotch peasant in arms, looked inferior to what they really were,\\nand felt so--and the mother felt it for them, though Colin was her own\\nimmediate heir and the pride of her heart. She bade him farewell with\\nsuppressed tears, and a sense of loss which was not to be suppressed.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHe has his ain hame, and his ain place, and little need of us now, the\\nLord be praised,â\\x80\\x9d the Mistress said to herself as she watched him going\\ndown to the boat; â\\x80\\x9cI think I would be real content if he had but a good\\nwife.â\\x80\\x9d But still it was with a sigh that she went in again and closed\\nthe door upon the departing boat that carried her son back to the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\\n\\n\\nAs for Colin and his friend, they went upon their way steadily, with\\nthat rare sympathy in difference which is the closest bond of\\nfriendship. Lauderdale by this time had lost almost all the lingerings\\nof youth which had hung long about him, perhaps by right of his union\\nwith the fresh and exuberant youth of his brother-in-arms. His gaunt\\nperson was gaunter than ever, though, by an impulse of the tenderest\\npride--not for himself but for his companion--his dress fitted him\\nbetter, and was more carefully put on than it had even been during all\\nhis life; but his long hair, once so black and wild, was now grey, and\\nhung in thin locks, and his beard, that relic of Italy, which Lauderdale\\npreserved religiously, and had ceased to be ashamed of, was grey also,\\nand added to the somewhat solemn aspect of his long thoughtful face. He\\nwas still an inch or two taller than Colin, whose great waves of brown\\nhair, tossed up like clouds upon his forehead, and shining brown eyes,\\nwhich even now had not quite lost the soft shade of surprise and\\nadmiration which had given them such a charm in their earlier years,\\ncontrasted strangely with the worn looks of his friend. They were not\\nlike father and son; for Lauderdale preserved in his appearance an\\nindefinable air of solitude and of a life apart, which made it\\nimpossible to think of him in any such relationship; but perhaps their\\nunion was more close and real than even that tie could have made it,\\nsince the unwedded childless man was at once young and old, and had kept\\nin his heart a virgin freshness more visionary, and perhaps even more\\nspotless, than that of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s untarnished youth; for, to be sure, the\\nyoung man not only was conscious of that visionary woman in the clouds,\\nbut had already solaced himself with more than one love, and still meant\\nto marry a wife like other men, though that was not at present the\\nforemost idea in his mind; whereas, whatever love Lauderdale might have\\nhad in that past from which he never drew the veil, it had never been\\nreplaced by another, nor involved any earthly hope.\\n\\nAs they crossed the borders, and found themselves among the Cumberland\\nhills, Lauderdale began to make gradual advances to a subject which had\\nbeen for a long time left in silence between them. Perhaps it required\\nthat refinement of ear natural to a born citizen of Glasgow to recognise\\nthat it was â\\x80\\x9cEnglishâ\\x80\\x9d which was being spoken round them as they\\nadvanced--but the philosopher supposed himself to have made that\\ndiscovery. He recurred to it with a certain pathetic meaning as they\\nwent upon their way. They had set out on foot from Carlisle, each with\\nhis knapsack, to make their leisurely way to the Lakes; and, when they\\nstopped to refresh themselves at the humble roadside inn which was their\\nfirst resting-place, the plaintive cadence of his friendâ\\x80\\x99s voice struck\\nColin with a certain amusement. â\\x80\\x9cTheyâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 English here,â\\x80\\x9d Lauderdale\\nsaid, with a tone of sad recollection, as a man might have said in\\nNorway or Russia, hearing for the first time the foreign tongue, and\\nbethinking himself of all the dreary seas and long tracts of country\\nthat lay between him and home. It might have been pathetic under such\\ncircumstances, though the chances are that even then Colin, graceless\\nand fearless, would have laughed; but at present, when the absence was\\nonly half a dayâ\\x80\\x99s march, and the difference of tongue, as we have said,\\nonly to be distinguished by an ear fine and native, the sigh was too\\nabsurd to be passed over lightly. â\\x80\\x9cI never knew you have the _mal du\\npays_ before,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said with a burst of laughter:--and the patriot\\nhimself did not refuse to smile.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak English,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a quaint self-contradiction; â\\x80\\x9cthough I\\nshould say speak Scotch if I was consistent;--you needna make your jokes\\nat me. Oh ay, itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy laughing. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no _that_ Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of;\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing out of the way in the association of ideas this time,\\nthough they play bonnie pranks whiles. Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of the first time I\\nwas in England, and how awfuâ\\x80\\x99 queer it sounded to hear the bits of\\ncallants on the road, and the poor bodies at the cottage doors.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe first time you were in England--that was when you came to nurse\\nme,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI should have died that time but for my mother and\\nyou.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m not saying that,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re one of the kind thatâ\\x80\\x99s\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to kill--but itâ\\x80\\x99s no that Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of. There are other\\nthings that come to my mind with the sound of the English tongue. Hold\\nyour peace, callant, and listen; is there nothing comes back to your ain\\nmind when you hear the like of _that_?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI hear a woman talking very broad Cumberland,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who\\nnotwithstanding began to feel an uncomfortable heat mounting upwards in\\nhis face; â\\x80\\x9cyou may call it English, if you have a mind. There is some\\nimperceptible difference between that and the Dumfriesshire, I suppose;\\nbut I should not like to have to discriminate where the difference\\nlies.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAs for Lauderdale, he sighed; but without intending it, as it appeared,\\nfor he made a great effort to cover his sigh with a yawn, for which\\nlatter indulgence he had evidently no occasion; and then he tried a\\nfaint little unnecessary laugh. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 man for associations,â\\x80\\x9d he\\nsaid; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m no to be held to account for the things that come into my\\nhead. You may say itâ\\x80\\x99s Cumberland, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no disputing; but for aâ\\x80\\x99 that\\nthereâ\\x80\\x99s something in the sound of the voice----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLook here,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin impatiently; â\\x80\\x9clisten to my tract. I want you to\\ngive me your opinion now it is finished; turn this way, with your face\\nto the hills, and never mind the voice.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with another sigh; â\\x80\\x9cthereâ\\x80\\x99s nae voice like\\nhis ain voice to this callantâ\\x80\\x99s ear; itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 thing to be an\\nauthor, and above aâ\\x80\\x99 a reformer; for you may be sure itâ\\x80\\x99s for the sake\\nof the cause, and no because heâ\\x80\\x99s written aâ\\x80\\x99 that himselâ\\x80\\x99. Letâ\\x80\\x99s hear\\nthis grand tract of yours; no that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve any particular faith, in that\\nway of working,â\\x80\\x9d he added impartially. It was not encouraging perhaps to\\nthe young author; but Colin was sufficiently used by this time to his\\nfriendâ\\x80\\x99s predilections, and for his own part was very well pleased to\\nescape from memories more perplexing and difficult to manage. It was\\nwith this intention that he had taken out No. I. of the _Tracts for the\\nTimes_. If any of the writers of the original series of these renowned\\ncompositions could but have looked over the shoulder of the young Scotch\\nminister, and beheld the different fashion of thoughts, the curious\\nfundamental difference which lay underneath, and yet the apparent\\nsimilarity of intention on the face of it! Rome and the Pope were about\\nas far off as Mecca and the prophet from Colinâ\\x80\\x99s ideas. He was not in\\nthe least urgent for any infallible standard, nor at all concerned to\\ntrace a direct line of descent for himself or his Church; and yet withal\\nhis notions were as high and absolute and arbitrary on some points as if\\nhe had been a member of the most potent of hierarchies. It would,\\nhowever, be doing Colin injustice to reproduce here this revolutionary\\ndocument: to tell the truth, circumstances occurred very soon after to\\nretard the continuation of the series, and, so far as his historian is\\naware, the publication of this preliminary[4] address was only partial.\\nFor, to be sure, the young man had still abundance of time before him,\\nand the first and most important thing, as Lauderdale suggested, was the\\npreparation of an audience--an object which was on the whole better\\ncarried out by partial and private circulation than by coming\\nprematurely before the public, and giving the adversary occasion to\\nblaspheme, and perhaps frightening the Kirk herself out of her wits.\\n\\nHaving said so much, we may return to the more private and individual\\naspect of affairs. The two friends were seated, while all this was going\\non, out of doors, on a stone bench by the grey wall of the cottage inn,\\nin which they had just refreshed themselves with a nondescript meal. The\\nCumberland hills--at that moment bleaching under the sunshine, showing\\nall their scars and stains in the fulness of the light--stretched far\\naway into the distance, hiding religiously in their depths the sacred\\nwoods and waters that were the end of the pilgrimage on which the two\\nfriends were bound. Lauderdale sat at leisure and listened, shading the\\nsunshine from his face, and watching the shadows play on the woods and\\nhills; and the same force of imagination which persuaded the\\nunaccustomed traveller that he could detect a difference of tone in the\\nrude talk he heard in the distance, and that that which was only the\\ndialect of Cumberland was _English_, persuaded him also that the\\nsunshine in which he was sitting was warmer than the sunshine at home,\\nand that he was really, as he himself would have described it, â\\x80\\x9cgoing\\nsouth.â\\x80\\x9d He was vaguely following out these ideas, notwithstanding that\\nhe also listened to Colin, and gave him the fullest attention.\\nLauderdale had not travelled much in his life, nor enjoyed many\\nholidays; and, consequently, the very sense of leisure and novelty\\nrecalled to him the one great recreation of his life--the spring he had\\nspent in Italy, with all its vicissitudes, prefaced by the mournful days\\nat Wodensbourne. All this came before Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s mind more strongly a\\ngreat deal than it did before that of Colin, because it was to the elder\\nman the one sole and clearly marked escape out of the monotony of a long\\nlife--a thing that had occurred but once, and never could occur again.\\nHow the Cumberland hills, and the peasant voices in their rude dialect,\\nand the rough stone bench outside the door of a grey lime-stone cottage,\\ncould recall to Lauderdale the olive slopes of Frascati, the tall houses\\nshut up and guarded against the sunshine, and the far-off solemn waste\\nof the Campagna, would have been something unintelligible to Colin. But\\nin the meantime these recollections were coming to a climax in his\\ncompanionâ\\x80\\x99s mind. He gave a great start in the midst of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s most\\neloquent paragraph, and jumped to his feet, crying, â\\x80\\x9cDo you hear that?â\\x80\\x9d\\nwith a thrill of excitement utterly inexplicable to the astonished young\\nman: and then Lauderdale grew suddenly ashamed of himself, and took his\\nseat again, abashed, and felt that it was needful to explain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo I hear what?â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and, as this interruption occurred just at\\nthe moment when he supposed he had roused his hearer to a certain pitch\\nof excitement and anxiety, by his account of the religious deficiencies\\nof Scotland, which he was on the point of relieving by an able\\nexposition of the possibilities of reform, it may be forgiven to him if\\nhe spoke with a little asperity. Such a disappointment is a trying\\nexperience to the best of men. â\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, for Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s sake?â\\x80\\x9d said the\\nyoung man, forgetting he was a minister; and, to tell the truth,\\nLauderdale was so much ashamed of himself that he felt almost unable to\\nexplain.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s singing something, thatâ\\x80\\x99s aâ\\x80\\x99,â\\x80\\x9d said the confused philosopher.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 haveril, Colin. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s some things I canna get out of my\\nhead. Never you mind; aâ\\x80\\x99 thatâ\\x80\\x99s admirable,â\\x80\\x9d said the culprit, with a\\ncertain deprecatory eagerness. â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m awfuâ\\x80\\x99 anxious to see how you get us\\nout of the scrape. Go on.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin was angry, but he was human, and he could not but laugh at the\\ndiscomfiture and conciliatory devices of his disarmed critic. â\\x80\\x9cI am not\\ngoing to throw away my pearls,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9csince your mind is in such a\\ndeplorable state you shall hear no more to-day. Oh, no. I understand the\\nextent of your anxiety. And so hereâ\\x80\\x99s Lauderdale going the way of all\\nflesh. Who is _she_? and what is she singing? The best policy is to make\\na clean breast of it,â\\x80\\x9d said the young man, laughing; â\\x80\\x9cand then, perhaps\\nI may look over the insult you have been guilty of to myself.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBut Lauderdale was in no mood for laughing. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be the best plan\\nto go on,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cfor Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been giving my best attention; and maybe\\nif I was to speak out what was in my heart--â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak it out,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. He was a little affronted, but he kept his\\ncomposure. As he folded up his papers and put them away in his\\npocket-book, he too heard the song which Lauderdale had been listening\\nto. It was only a countrywoman singing as she went about her work, and\\nthere was no marked resemblance in the voice to anything he had heard\\nbefore. Yet he knew what was coming when he put up his papers in his\\npocket-book, and it occurred to him that perhaps it would be well to\\nhave the explanation over and be done with it, for he knew how\\npersistent his companion was.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s no that thereâ\\x80\\x99s much to say,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, changing his tone;\\nâ\\x80\\x9ca man like me, thatâ\\x80\\x99s little used to change, getâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 like a fool in\\nhis associations. Thereâ\\x80\\x99s naething that ony reasonable creature could\\nsee in thae hills, and aâ\\x80\\x99 the sheep on them, that should bring _that_ to\\nmy mind; and, as you say, callant, itâ\\x80\\x99s Cumberland theyâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 speaking,\\nand no English. Itâ\\x80\\x99s just a kind of folly that men are subject to that\\nlive their lane. I canna but go aâ\\x80\\x99 through again, from the beginning\\nto---- Well, I suppose,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale with a sigh, â\\x80\\x9cwhat you and me\\nwould call the end.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat any man in his senses would call the end,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, beginning\\nto cut his pencil with some ferocity, which was the only occupation that\\npresented itself to him for the moment; â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t suppose there can be\\nany question as to what you mean. Was it to be expected that I should\\ncourt rejection over again for the mere pleasure of being rejected?--as\\nyou know I have been, both by letter and in person; and then, as if even\\nthat was not enough, accused of fortune-hunting; when Heaven knows----â\\x80\\x9d\\nHere Colin stopped short, and cut his pencil so violently that he cut\\nhis finger, an act which convicted him of using unnecessary force, and\\nof which accordingly he was ashamed.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt is no _that_ I was thinking of,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cI was minding of\\nthe time when we aâ\\x80\\x99 met first, and the bit soft English voice--itâ\\x80\\x99s no\\nthat Iâ\\x80\\x99m fond of the English, or their ways,â\\x80\\x9d continued the philosopher.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re maybe no so well in our ain country, and maybe weâ\\x80\\x99re better; Iâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nno say. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a question awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard to settle. But, if ever we aâ\\x80\\x99\\nforegather again, I cannot think there will be that difference. It wasna\\nto say musical that I ken of, but it was aye soft and pleasant--maybe\\nower soft, Colin, for the like of you--and with a bit yielding tone in\\nit, as if the heart would break sooner than make a stand for its own\\nway. I mind it real weel,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, with a sigh. â\\x80\\x9cAs for the\\nfather, no doubt there was little to be said in his favour. But, after\\naâ\\x80\\x99, it wasna him that you had any intention to marry. And yon\\nSabbath-day after he was gone, poor man!--when you and me didna ken what\\nto do with ourselves till the soft thing came out of her painted\\nchaâ\\x80\\x99amer, and took the guiding of us into her hands. Itâ\\x80\\x99s _that_ I was\\nthinking of,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, fixing his eyes on a far-off point upon\\nthe hills, and ending his musings with a sigh.\\n\\nColin sighed, too, for sympathy--he could not help it. The scene came\\nbefore him as his friend spoke. He thought he could see Alice, in her\\npallor and exhaustion, worn to a shadow, in her black dress, coming into\\nthe bare Italian room in the glorious summer day, which all the\\nprecautions possible could not shut out from the house of mourning--with\\nher prayer-book in her hand; and then he remembered how she had chidden\\nhim for reading another lesson than that appointed for the day. It was\\nin the height of his own revolutionary impulses that this thought struck\\nhim; and he smiled to himself in the midst of his sigh, with a tender\\nthought for Alice, and a passing wonder for himself, what change might\\nhave been wrought upon him if that dutiful little soul had actually\\nbecome the companion of his life. Colin was not the kind of man who can\\npropose to himself to form his wifeâ\\x80\\x99s mind, and rule her thoughts, and\\ninfluence her without being sensible of her influence in return. That\\nwas not the order of domestic affairs in Ramore; and naturally he judged\\nthe life that might have been, and even yet might be, by that standard.\\nThe Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s son did not understand having a nullity, or a shadow of\\nhimself, for a wife; and insensibly he made his way back from the\\n_attendrissement_ into which Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s musings had led him, into\\nhalf-amused speculation as to the effect Alice and her influence might\\nhave had upon him by this time. â\\x80\\x9cIf _that_ had happened,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a\\nsmile, bursting out, as was usual to him when Lauderdale was his\\ncompanion, at that particular point of his thoughts which required\\nexpression, without troubling himself to explain how he came there--â\\x80\\x9cif\\n_that_ had happened,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with the conscious smile of old, â\\x80\\x9cI\\nwonder what sort of fellow I should have been by this time? I doubt if I\\nshould have had any idea of disturbing the constituted order of affairs.\\nThings are always for the best, you perceive, as everybody says. A man\\nwho has any revolutionary work to do must be free and alone. But donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nlet us talk any more of this--I donâ\\x80\\x99t like turning back upon the road.\\nBut for that feeling I should have settled the business before now about\\npoor Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x98Voice from the Grave.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI was aye against that title,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cif he would have paid\\nany attention; but youâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 the same, you young callants; itâ\\x80\\x99s nae more\\na voice from the grave than mine is. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a voice from an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 real\\nlife, that had nae intention to lose a minute that was permitted. It\\nwould be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 agreeable to ken if he was permitted to have any pleasure\\nin his book; but then, so far as I can judge, he maun ken an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 deal\\nbetter by this time--and maybe up there theyâ\\x80\\x99re no heeding about a third\\nedition. Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to say; he was so terrible like himself up to the\\nlast moment; I canna imagine, in my own mind, that heâ\\x80\\x99s no like himself\\nstill. There should be a heap of siller,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cby this\\ntime; and sooner or later youâ\\x80\\x99ll have to open communication, and let\\nthem ken.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a momentary look of sullenness and repugnance;\\nand then he added, in a lighter tone, â\\x80\\x9cheaps of money never came out of\\na religious publisherâ\\x80\\x99s hands. A third edition does not mean the same\\nthing with them as with other people. Of course, it must be set right\\nsome time or other. We had better set off, I can tell you, and not talk\\nidle talk like this, if we mean to get to our journeyâ\\x80\\x99s end to-night.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, ay,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re aye in a hurry, you young\\ncallants. Is it the father that makes you so unwilling for any\\ncorrespondence?--but itâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 easy to settle a thing like that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI think you want to try how far my patience can go,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, who\\nhad grown crimson up to the hair. â\\x80\\x9cDo you think a man has no feeling,\\nLauderdale? Do you think it is possible to be treated as I have been,\\nand yet go back again with humility, hat in hand? I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel myself\\ncapable of that.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf youâ\\x80\\x99re asking me my opinion,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, calmly, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve nae\\nobjection to tell you what I think. Youâ\\x80\\x99re no vindictive, and youâ\\x80\\x99ve nae\\npride to speak of--Iâ\\x80\\x99m meaning pride of _that_ kind. Itâ\\x80\\x99s no in you to\\nbear a grudge at onybody, beyond, maybe, the hour or the day. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nheeding much about that question, for my part. If you had an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nregard for the man, he might affront you; but no being indifferent. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\ntelling you just my opinion, with my partial knowledge of the premises;\\nand for _her_, I cannot but say what is in my ain mind. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve a kind of\\nlonging to see her again; we used to be awfuâ\\x80\\x99 good friends, her and me.\\nI had you to take care of, callant, and she had _him_; and whiles she\\nhad a moment of envy, and grudged terrible in her heart to see the air\\nand the sun, that are for baith the good and the evil, so hard upon him,\\nand so sweet to you. There was little in her mind to hide, and her and\\nme were good friends. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never forget our counts and our reckonings.\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s awfuâ\\x80\\x99 hard for the like oâ\\x80\\x99 me to divine wherefore it is that aâ\\x80\\x99\\nthat has come to an end, and her and you dropped out of one anotherâ\\x80\\x99s\\nlife.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLauderdale,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a little choking in his voice, â\\x80\\x9cI will\\ntell you what I never told you before----â\\x80\\x9d and then the young man\\nstopped short, as if he had received a blow. What was it that came over\\nhim like an imperious sudden prohibition, stopping the words upon his\\nlips the first time he had ever dreamt of uttering them to mortal ear?\\nHe had a feeling somehow as if one of those flying shadows that kept\\ncoming and going over the mountains had taken visible shape and stepped\\nbefore him, and put a cold hand on his lips. He was about to have\\nconfessed that his love had been no more than tender compassion and\\nkindness; he was about to have said what Lauderdale perhaps might have\\nguessed before, what Colin had kept secret and hidden in his\\nbreast--that Alice never was nor could be the ideal woman of his\\nthoughts, the true love who waited for him somewhere in the future. But\\nperhaps, after all, it was no shadow nor unseen influence, but only the\\nyoung manâ\\x80\\x99s magnanimous heart that spared that humiliation to the name\\nof Alice--solely to her name; for, now that all was over between them,\\nit was only that abstract representation of her that was concerned.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAy,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, after a moment, â\\x80\\x9cyou were going to tell me----â\\x80\\x9d\\nand then he rose as Colin had done, and threw his knapsack on his\\nshoulder, and prepared to resume his march.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe shall have an hourâ\\x80\\x99s walking in the dark, if we donâ\\x80\\x99t make all the\\nbetter progress,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; â\\x80\\x9cwhich is uncomfortable when one does not\\nknow the way. And now to return to No I.â\\x80\\x9d he said with a laugh, as they\\nwent on along the dusty road. There was not another word said between\\nthem of the confession thus abruptly stopped. Perhaps Lauderdale in his\\nheart had a perception of what it meant; but, however that might be,\\nboth fell at once with eagerness, as if they had never digressed for a\\nmoment, upon the first number of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s _Tracts for the Times_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX.\\n\\n\\nThis conversation, however, as was natural, had a certain effect upon\\nboth the friends. It threw Colin, who, to be sure, was chiefly\\nconcerned, into a world of confused imaginations, which influenced even\\nhis dreams, and through his dreams reacted upon himself. When he was\\nalone at night, instead of going to sleep at once, as would have been\\nnatural after his dayâ\\x80\\x99s journey, he kept falling into absurd little\\ndozes, and waking up suddenly with the idea that Alice was standing by\\nhim, that she was calling him, that it was the marriage-day, and that\\nsomebody had found him out, and was about to tell his bride that he did\\nnot love her; and at last, when he went to sleep in good earnest, the\\nfantastic _mÃ©lange_ of recollection and imagination carried him back to\\nFrascati, where he found Arthur and Alice, as of old, in the great\\n_salone_, with its frescoed walls, and talked to them as in former days.\\nHe thought Meredith told him of an important journey upon which he was\\nsetting out, and made arrangements in the meantime for his sister with\\nan anxiety which the real Arthur had never dreamt of exhibiting. â\\x80\\x9cShe\\nwill be safe with you at present,â\\x80\\x9d the visionary Arthur seemed to say,\\nâ\\x80\\x9cand by-and-by you can send her to me----â\\x80\\x9d And when Colin woke it was\\nhard for him to convince himself at first that he had not been in actual\\ncommunication with his friend. He accounted for it, of course, as it is\\nvery easy to account for dreams, and made up his mind how it came about,\\nand yet left behind in some crevice of his heart a dumb certainty which\\nhid itself out of sight that it might not be argued with, that after all\\nArthur and he in the dark had passed by each other, and exchanged a word\\nor thought in passing. Colin took care not to betray even to himself\\nthe existence of this conviction; but deep down in the silence it\\ninfluenced him unawares.\\n\\nAs for Lauderdale, his thoughts, as might have been expected, had taken\\nanother direction. Perhaps he was past the age of dreaming. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\nrevelation which he did not make had possibly told his friend more than\\nif it had been said out in words; and the two began their second dayâ\\x80\\x99s\\njourney with but little talk, and that of a vague and general kind. They\\nhad not gone far upon the white and dusty road when Lauderdale drew\\naside a little, and stepped across the boundary of furze and wild thorn\\nand bramble bushes which separated it from the hillside.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cNo, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no tired at this hour of the morning,â\\x80\\x9d he said, â\\x80\\x9cbut Iâ\\x80\\x99ve an\\nawfuâ\\x80\\x99 objection to dust, and the road is as powdery as a mill. My\\nintention is to take a seat on this brae and let that carriage pass.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWait a little, then; it comes on very slowly; there must be some\\ninvalid in it, for the horses look good enough,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin; and he\\nturned his back to the approaching carriage, about which he was\\naltogether indifferent, and faced round to the green slope, covered with\\ntrees and brushwood, upon which Lauderdale meant to rest. They were\\nseparated a little when the carriage came up, and neither of them paid\\nmuch attention to it. Lauderdale was already half way up the slope, and\\nColin was standing by the side of the road, looking after him. Then all\\nat once there was a sudden cry, and the horses made a dash forward, and\\nrolled the equipage along at such a pace that its occupants were quite\\nout of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s sight when he turned round. This he did with a start so\\nviolent that the stones under his feet seemed suddenly to get in his way\\nand trip him up: and Lauderdale for his part came down from the brae\\nwith a long leap and strange exclamation. â\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?â\\x80\\x9d they said to\\neach other, in the same breath, and paused for a moment, and looked into\\neach otherâ\\x80\\x99s faces, and listened. The carriage went on faster, raising a\\ncloud of dust, and nothing was to be heard except the sound of the\\nhorsesâ\\x80\\x99 hoofs and the wheels. It was Colin who was the first to break\\nthe silence. He detached himself from among the stones and bushes, where\\nhe had got entangled in that moment of agitation, and sprang back again\\nto the high road which lay before him, veiled in a cloud of dust. â\\x80\\x9cIt is\\nsimply absurd,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cLauderdale, I cannot imagine what you mean;\\nyou are enough to drive a man mad. Some one gives a chance outcry in\\npassing, and you make up your mind that it is---- Good heavens! I never\\nknew such folly!â\\x80\\x9d cried the young man. He took off his hat without\\nknowing it, and thrust his hair up over his forehead, and made an effort\\nto take courage and regain his composure as he took breath. But it was\\nvery clear that Lauderdale had nothing to do with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s excitement. He\\nhad himself heard the cry, and felt in his heart that it was no\\nimagination. As he stood there in his pretended indignation the impulse\\nof flight came upon him, mingled with a terror, which he could not\\nexplain nor comprehend. There was not a man in existence before whom he\\nwould have flown; but that little cry of recognition took away all his\\ncourage. He did not feel in himself the strength to go forward, to\\nventure upon a possible meeting. The blood which had rushed to his face\\nfor the first moment seemed to go back upon his heart and stifle it. He\\nhad made a step or two forward without thinking; but then he stopped\\nhimself, and wavered, and looked upon the road which lay quite tranquil\\nbehind him in the shadow of the hills. It seemed to him for the moment\\nas if his only safety was in flight.\\n\\nAs for Lauderdale, it took him all the time which Colin had occupied in\\nthese thoughts to get down from his elevation and return to his friendâ\\x80\\x99s\\nside. He for his part was animated and eager. â\\x80\\x9cThis is no _her_\\ncountry,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x99s a traveller, as we are. The carriage\\nwill stop at our next stage, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s no time to be lost;â\\x80\\x9d and as he\\nsaid these words he resumed his march with that long steady step which\\ngot over so much ground without remarking the hesitation of Colin, or\\nwhat he had said. The young man himself felt that saving impulse fail\\nhim after the first minute. Afterwards, all the secondary motives came\\ninto his mind, and urged him to go on. Had he allowed that he was afraid\\nto meet or to renew his relationships with Alice Meredith, supposing\\nthat by any extraordinary chance this should be she, it would be to\\nbetray the secret which he had guarded so long, and to betray himself;\\nand he knew no reason that he could give for such a cowardly retreat. He\\ncould not say, â\\x80\\x9cIf I see her again, and find that she has been thinking\\nof me, I shall be compelled to carry out my original mistake, and give\\nup my brighter hopes,â\\x80\\x9d--for no one knew that he had made any mistake, or\\nthat she was not to his eyes the type of all that was dearest in woman.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThe chances are that it is all a piece of folly--a deception of the\\nsenses,â\\x80\\x9d he said to himself instead--â\\x80\\x9csomething like what people have\\nwhen they think they see ghosts. We have talked of her, and I have\\ndreamed of her, and now, to be sore, necessity requires that I should\\nhear her. It should have been seeing, to make all perfect;â\\x80\\x9d and, after\\nthat little piece of self-contempt, he went on again with Lauderdale\\nwithout making any objection. The dust which had been raised by the\\ncarriage came towards them like a moving pillar; but the carriage itself\\nwent rapidly on and turned the corner and went out of sight. And then\\nColin did his best to comfort and strengthen himself by other means.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t put yourself out of breath,â\\x80\\x9d he said to Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cthe whole\\nthing is quite explainable. That absurd imagination of yours yesterday\\nhas got into both our heads. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mind saying I dreamt of it all last\\nnight. Anything so wild was never put into a novel. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an optical\\nillusion, or, rather I should say, itâ\\x80\\x99s an ocular illusion. Things donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nhappen in real life in this kind of promiscuous way. Donâ\\x80\\x99t walk so quick\\nand put yourself out of breath.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDid you no hear?â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cIf you hadna heard I could\\nunderstand. As for me, I canna say but what I saw as well. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no\\nminding at this moment about my breath.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat did you see?â\\x80\\x9d cried Colin, with a sudden thrill at his heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll no say it was _her_,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cno but what I am as sure\\nas I am of life that she was there. I saw something white laid back in\\nthe carriage, somebody that was ill; it might be her or it might be\\nanother. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 strong conviction that it was her. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been\\nborne in on my mind that she was ill and wearying. We mightna ken _her_,\\nbut she kent you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWhat you say makes it more and more unlikely,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI confess\\nthat I was a little excited myself by those dreams and stuff; but\\nnothing could be more improbable than that she should recognise you and\\nme. Bah! it is absurd to be talking of _her_ in this ridiculous way, as\\nif we had the slightest reason to suppose it was she. Any little\\nmovement might make a sick lady cry out; and, as for recognising a\\nvoice!--All this makes me feel like a fool,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI am more\\ndisposed to go back than to go on. I wish you would dismiss this\\nnonsense from your thoughts.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I was to do that same, do you think you could join me?â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s voices I would ken after thirty years instead of\\nafter three; and Iâ\\x80\\x99m no likely to forget the bit English tone of it. Iâ\\x80\\x99m\\na wee slow about some things, and Iâ\\x80\\x99ll no pretend to fathom your\\nmeaning; but, whether itâ\\x80\\x99s daftlike or no, this Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure of, that if\\nyou make up to that carriage thatâ\\x80\\x99s away out of our sight at this\\nmoment, youâ\\x80\\x99ll find Alice Meredith there.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe anything of the kind. Your imagination has deceived\\nyou,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, and they went on for a long time in silence; but at\\nthe bottom of his heart Colin felt that his own imagination had not\\ndeceived him. The only thing that had deceived him was that foolish\\nfeeling of liberty, that sense that he had escaped fate, and that the\\nrash engagements of his youth were to have no consequences, into which\\nhe had deluded himself for some time past. Even while he professed his\\nutter disbelief in this encounter, he was asking himself how in his\\nchanged circumstances he should bear the old bridle, the rein upon his\\nown proud neck? If it had been a curb upon his freedom, even at the\\nmoment when he had formed it--if it had become a painful bondage\\nafterwards while still the impression of Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s gentle tenderness had\\nnot quite worn off his mind--what would it be now when he had\\nemancipated himself from those soft prejudices of recollection, and when\\nhe had acknowledged so fully to himself that his heart never had been\\nreally touched? He marched on by Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s side, and paid no\\nattention to what his friend said to him; and nothing could be more\\ndifficult to describe than the state of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind during this walk.\\nPerhaps the only right thing, the only sensible thing he could have done\\nin the circumstances, would have been to turn back and decline\\naltogether this reawakening of the past. But then at six-and-twenty the\\nmind is still so adverse to turning back, and has so much confidence in\\nits own power of surmounting difficulty, and in its good star, and in\\nthe favour and assistance of all powers and influences in heaven and\\nearth; and his pride was up in arms against such a mode of extricating\\nhimself from the apparent difficulty, and all the delicacy of his nature\\nrevolted from the idea of thus throwing the wrong and humiliation upon\\nthe woman, upon Alice, a creature who had loved him and trusted him, and\\nwhom he had never owned he did not love.\\n\\nUnderneath all these complications there was, to be sure, a faint,\\nsustaining hope that an encounter of this kind was incredible--that it\\nmight turn out not to be Alice at all, and that all these fears and\\nembarrassments might come to nothing. With all this in his mind he\\nmarched on, feeling the sweet air and fresh winds and sunshine to be all\\nso many spectators accompanying him perhaps to the turning-point of his\\nlife, where, for all he knew, things might go against him, and his\\nwings be clipped, and his future limited for ever and ever. Perhaps some\\nof Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friends may think that he exhibited great weakness of mind on\\nthis occasion--and, indeed, it is certain that there are many people who\\nbelieve, with great reason, that it is next thing to a sin to put honour\\nin the place of love, or to give to constancy the rights of passion. But\\nthen, whatever a manâ\\x80\\x99s principles may be, it is his character in most\\ncases that carries the day. Every man must act according to his own\\nnature, as says the Arabian sage. Sir Bayard, even, thinking it all\\nover, might not approve of himself, and might see a great deal of folly\\nin what he was doing; but, as for a manâ\\x80\\x99s opinion of himself, that\\ncounts for very little; and he could only go on and follow out his\\ncareer in his own way.\\n\\nLauderdale, on his side, had less comprehension of his friend at this\\npoint of his character than at any other. He had discouraged, as far as\\nhe was able, the earlier steps of the engagement between Colin and\\nAlice; but when things â\\x80\\x9chad gone so farâ\\x80\\x9d the philosopher understood no\\ncompromise. He hastened on through the dust, for his part, with a tender\\nanxiety in his heart, concerned for the girl who had approached him more\\nnearly than any woman had done since the days of his youth; who had been\\nto him that mingled type of sister, daughter, dependent, and ruler,\\nwhich a very young, very innocent, woman sometimes is to a man too old\\nto fall in love with her, or even to think of such a weakness. Such love\\nas had been possible to Lauderdale had been given early in his\\nlife--given once and done with; and Colin had filled up all the place in\\nhis heart which might have been left vacant as a prey to vagrant\\naffections. At present, he was occupied with the thought that Alice was\\nill, and that the little cry she had uttered had a tone of appeal in it,\\nand was in reality a cry for help to those who had succoured her in her\\nloneliness, and been more to her for one little period of her life than\\nfather or family. And Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friend and guardian pursued his way with\\ngreat strides, going to the rescue of the tender little suffering\\ncreature, the mournful, yet dutiful little woman, who had borne her\\ngrief so courageously at Frascati, where they two were all the\\nprotectors, all the comforters she had. Thus the friends went on with\\ntheir different sentiments, saying little to each other, and not a word\\nupon this particular subject. They had meant to pause at a village which\\nwas on their way to Windermere to rest during the heat of the day and\\nrefresh themselves; and it was here, according to all likelihood, that\\nthe carriage which had passed with the invalid would also stop, to\\nrepose the sick lady if she was a stranger--to await the approach of the\\ntwo pedestrians if it was Alice, and if she was free to take such a\\nstep. Lauderdale had no doubt either of the one or the other of these\\nfacts; and, to tell the truth, Colin, regarding the matter under an\\naltogether different aspect, had little doubt on his part that the\\ncrisis of his fate had arrived.\\n\\nNevertheless, when he saw the first straggling houses of the\\nhamlet--rude little Westmoreland houses, grey and simple, with a\\nmoorland air, and no great proprietor near at hand to trim them into\\nmodel cottages---- It is so hard to believe what goes against oneâ\\x80\\x99s\\nwishes. After all, perhaps, the end would be a laugh, an exclamation of\\nsurprise, a blessed sense of relief; and no dreadful apparition of old\\nties and old vows to bind the freedman over again in cold blood and\\nwithout any illusion. Such feverish hopes came into Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind against\\nhis will, as they drew nearer. The road was as dusty as ever, but he did\\nnot see the broad mark of the carriage wheels; and with a great throb of\\nrelief found when they came in sight of the little inn that there was no\\ncarriage, nothing but a farmerâ\\x80\\x99s gig before the door. He began to\\nbreathe again, throwing off his burden. â\\x80\\x9cIt might be one of my farmers\\nfor anything one could tell to the contrary,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, with a short\\nlaugh, and a sense of relief past describing. â\\x80\\x9cYou see now what fools we\\nwere to suppose----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAt that moment, however, he stopped short in the midst of his sentence.\\nA man was coming to meet them, who might have been, for anything, as\\nColin said, that one could say to the contrary, the farmer to whom the\\ngig belonged. He was at present but a black figure against the sunshine,\\nwith his face shaded by his hat; but notwithstanding Colin stopped short\\nwhen he came in sight of him, and his heart stopped beating,--or at\\nleast he thought so. He had seen this man once in his life before,--but\\nonce, and no more. But there are some circumstances which sharpen and\\nintensify the senses. Colin recognised him the moment his eyes rested on\\nhim. He stopped short, because what he was saying was proved to be\\nfolly, and worse than folly. It was a denial of the certainty which had\\nsuddenly appeared before his eyes. He stopped without explaining why he\\nstopped, and made a step onwards in a confused and bewildered way.\\nHenceforward Lauderdale had nothing to do with it. It was Colin himself\\nas the principal and contracting party who was concerned.\\n\\nAnd the stranger, for his part, who had also seen the young man but once\\nin his life, recognised Colin. It had only been for a moment, and it was\\nnearly four years ago, but still Mr. Meredith knew, when he saw him, the\\nyoung man whom he had bidden to begone for a fortune-hunter; who had\\nclosed his sonâ\\x80\\x99s eyes, and laid Arthur in his grave; and given to Alice\\nin her desolation the tenderest guardianship. He did not know\\nLauderdale, who had his share in all but the last act of that sad little\\ndomestic drama; but he recognised Colin by intuition. He came forward to\\nhim with the courtesy of a man whom necessity compels to change all his\\ntactics. â\\x80\\x9cMr. Campbell, I think?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cI feel that I cannot be\\nmistaken. Alice was sure she saw you on the road. I came back after I\\nhad taken her home, to try whether I could meet you. Will you do me the\\nfavour to introduce me to your friend. I believe I am almost as much\\nindebted to him as to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThereâ\\x80\\x99s no debt on one side or the other,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale,\\ninterposing, for Colin found it difficult to speak. â\\x80\\x9cTell us how she is,\\nwhich is far more important. We heard her give a cry, and since then\\nweâ\\x80\\x99ve been hurrying on to see.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe is not strong,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith. â\\x80\\x9cI hope you will consent to\\ngratify Alice by going back with me. My house is close by here, and I\\ncame on purpose. Mr. Campbell, you may think you have a just grievance\\nagainst me. I hope you will overlook it at present, and hear my\\nexplanation afterwards. We can never be sufficiently grateful for all\\nyou have done for my son, both before his death and after. It was a\\nterrible dispensation of Providence; but I cannot be thankful enough\\nthat my poor boy lived to produce a work which has been of value to so\\nmany; and but for you it never could have been successfully published.\\nMy dear sir, I hope you will not suffer any personal feeling to me---- I\\nbeg you to believe that what I said was said in ignorance--I mean, I\\ntrust that you will not refuse to gratify Alice. She is almost all I\\nhave left,â\\x80\\x9d Mr. Meredith said, with a faltering voice. â\\x80\\x9cI have had great\\nlosses in my family. She has not been so much interested about anything\\nfor a long time. You will come with me, will you not, for Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s and\\nfor my daughterâ\\x80\\x99s sake?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIf any man could have said No to that appeal, Colin was not the man. He\\nmade little answer except a bow, and Mr. Meredith turned with them, and\\nthey all got into the country vehicle at the door of the little inn,\\nand drove off in silence to the house where Alice was awaiting them.\\nColin had scarcely a word to say as he drove along by her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s side.\\nThe gaiety, and freedom, and happy thoughts with which he had set out on\\nhis journey seemed to detach themselves from his mind, and abandon him\\none by one. His fate had encountered him where he had least expectation\\nof meeting it. And yet at the same time a compunction awoke in his heart\\nto think that it was in this way, like a captive brought back to her\\npresence, that the man whom Alice loved was going to her. He could have\\nfelt aggrieved and angry for her sake, if the claim of his own\\nreluctance and dread had not been nearer, and gained upon the more\\ngenerous feeling. And yet withal he had a longing to see her, a kind of\\ninclination to carry her off from this man, who had but a secondary\\nclaim upon her, and heal and cherish the wounded dove. Such was the\\nsingular medley of emotion, with which Colin was led back out of the\\nfree ways of his own choosing into the beaten path of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L.\\n\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHolmby is not my house,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith as they drove up the avenue;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI took it to please Alice. She has a fancy for the north now, as she\\nused to have for the south.â\\x80\\x9d As he said this he gave a wistful\\nside-glance at Colin, who had scarcely spoken during all the drive; and\\neven to this speech the young man made little response. The house was a\\npale grey house, of rough limestone, like the humbler houses, surrounded\\nby woods, and bearing anything but a cheerful aspect. The avenue was\\nlong and straight, and the cold commonplace outline of this secluded\\ndwelling-place filled up the vista between the two dark lines of trees,\\ngrowing gradually more distinct as they approached. Everything had a\\ncertain visionary aspect to Colin at the moment, and the look of the\\nhouse irritated him, as if it had been a type of the commonplace\\nexistence which he was henceforward to lead. He could not keep the cloud\\nthat was on his mind from appearing also on his countenance, though, at\\nthe same time, he could not help observing that Mr. Meredith looked at\\nhim often with a regard that was almost pathetic. To be sure, there was\\nnothing very elevated in the aspect of this man, whose history was not\\none which Colin liked to think of; but still it was evident that his\\nheart was trembling for his child, and that he was conveying to her the\\nlover whom he had once rejected and insulted, as he might have carried a\\ncostly medicine, hard to procure and of doubtful efficacy, but still the\\nonly thing that there was any hope in. Colin recognised this wistful\\nlook by the freemasonry of a mind equally excited, though in a different\\nway; and, as for Lauderdale, he looked on at both with a painful doubt\\nand uncertainty which had never before entered into his thoughts. For\\nall this time he had been trying to think it was Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s father, or even\\nAlice herself, who was to blame; and now only he began to see clearly\\nthe reluctance of his friend to its fullest extent--his reluctance and,\\nat the same time, that almost fantastic honour and delicacy which kept\\nthe young man from avowing even to his closest companion the real state\\nof his feelings. So that now, at the first moment for years in which the\\nfulfilment of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s engagement began to appear possible, Lauderdale,\\nwho had preached to him of constancy, who had longed after Alice, who\\nhad taken every opportunity of directing to her the truant thoughts of\\nhis friend, for the first time faltered. He began to see the other side\\nof the question just at the time when it would have been agreeable to\\nignore it. He saw not only that Colinâ\\x80\\x99s happiness was at stake, but that\\nit would be better for Alice even to break her heart if that was\\ninevitable, than to be married, not for love, but for honour; and\\nunhappily he recognised this just at the moment when Sir Bayard, Sir\\nQuixote, whatever absurd title you may please to give him--the\\nMistressâ\\x80\\x99s son, who was incapable of leaving a woman in the lurch, or\\ncasting upon her the shame of rejection--was going on to meet his fate.\\n\\nFrom this it will be seen that it was a very subdued and silent party\\nwhich was at this moment driving along the long avenue under the trees,\\nand making Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s heart beat, indoors on her sofa, with every turn of\\nthose wheels on the gravel. â\\x80\\x9cIs papa alone?â\\x80\\x9d she asked of her little\\nsister, who was at the window; and her heart was jumping up into her\\nthroat when she uttered that simple question, as if it would take away\\nher breath. When she received for answer a lengthened and interrupted\\ndescription of the two gentlemen who accompanied Mr. Meredith, Alice put\\nher head back on her pillows and closed her eyes in the sudden faintness\\nof her great joy. For she in her simplicity had no doubt about Colin.\\nIf he had not loved her he would not have turned back; he would never\\nhave come to her. It was the tender guardian of her loneliness, the\\nbetrothed in whom she had reposed the entire faith of her nature, whom\\nher father was bringing back to her; and, so far as Alice was concerned,\\nthe four intervening years might have had no existence. She had seen\\nnobody and done nothing during that dreary interval. Ill-health, and\\nseclusion, and mourning had made it appear to her that her life had\\ntemporarily stopped at the time when Mr. Meredith carried her off from\\nFrascati. And now, with Colin, life and strength and individuality were\\ncoming back. This was how the matter appeared on her side of affairs,\\nand it seemed to Alice the natural solution of the difficulty; for,\\nafter all, but for her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s cruel persistence against her, which\\nProvidence by many blows had broken and made to yield, she would have\\nbeen Colinâ\\x80\\x99s wife for all those years. And now, the one obstacle being\\nremoved, it seemed only natural to her straightforward and simple\\nintelligence that the long-deferred conclusion should arrive at last.\\n\\nBoth she and the little sister at the window were in mourning. Mrs.\\nMeredith was dead--the stepmother, who had been Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s greatest enemy;\\nand, of all the children who had once made their father indifferent to\\nhis elder son and daughter, the only one left was the little girl, who\\nwas giving her sister an elaborate description of the gentlemen who were\\nwith papa. This was why Mr. Meredith had yielded. Alice judged,\\naccording to her simple reckonings, with a little awe of the terrible\\nmeans employed, that it was Providence who had thus over-turned her\\nfatherâ\\x80\\x99s resolution, and made him yielding and tender. It did not occur\\nto her to ask whether for her happiness it was just or reasonable that\\nso many should suffer; she only accepted it as providential, just as\\nColin four years before had persuaded himself that all the circumstances\\nwhich had thrown them together were providential. And now the climax,\\nwhich the poor girl permitted herself to think God had been bringing\\nabout by all the family convulsions of these four years, came close, and\\nthe heart of Alice grew faint with thankfulness and joy. When she heard\\nthem coming upstairs she sat upright, recovering with her old force of\\nself-restraint her composure and calmness. Mr. Meredith came in with a\\nlittle bustle to spare his daughter the agitation of the meeting. â\\x80\\x9cYou\\nwere quite right, Alice, my love,â\\x80\\x9d he said, bringing them hurriedly up\\nto her. â\\x80\\x9cHere is Mr. Campbell and your friend, Mr. Lauderdale. They\\nrecognised you at the same minute as you recognised them; and, if I had\\nnot been so foolish as to tell John to drive on, we might have picked\\nthem up and saved them their walk. I thought she was ill,â\\x80\\x9d the anxious\\nfather continued, turning his back upon Alice and occupying himself with\\nLauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cShe had a fainting fit yesterday, and I was frightened it\\nwas coming on again, or I should have stopped and picked you up. We are\\na little dark here with all these trees. I would have them cut down if\\nHolmby were mine; but at this window, if you are fond of scenery, I can\\nshow you a beautiful view.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd it was thus that the two, who parted at Frascati as lovers within a\\nfew weeks of their marriage, met in the shaded drawing-room at Holmby.\\nThe most exciting events of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s life were framed within the\\ninterval; but nothing had happened individually to Alice. He seemed to\\nfind her exactly where he had left her, though with the sense of having\\nhimself travelled to an unutterable distance in the meantime. She did\\nnot say much in the tumult and confusion of her joy; she only held out\\nher hand to him, and lifted her soft eyes to his face with a look of\\nsupreme content and satisfaction, whim had the strangest effect upon\\nColin. He felt his doom fixed for ever and ever as he looked into the\\ngentle blue eyes which conveyed to him all that was in Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s heart.\\nAnd she had not the slightest suspicion of the heaviness that was in his\\nas he drew a chair near her sofa. â\\x80\\x9cAt last!â\\x80\\x9d she said softly, under her\\nbreath. The little sister stood by, looking on with round eyes opened to\\ntheir widest; but, as for Alice, she had no consciousness of any\\npresence but one. And Colin sat down by her without any answer, in his\\nheart not knowing what to say. Her black dress, her languid air, the\\npaleness one moment, and the flush of delicate colour the next, all\\nmoved him strangely. Even had he not been Bayard he could not have done\\nanything to wound the fair, feeble creature who looked at him with her\\nheart in her eyes. And naturally the consequence was, that Colin\\nanswered in a way far more decisive than any words--by clasping the soft\\nclinging hand, and bending down to kiss it as in the old Italian days.\\nAlice had never had any doubt of her betrothed, but at that moment she\\nfelt herself receiving the pledge of a new and more certain troth--and\\nin the revulsion from despondency and weakness her mouth was opened for\\nthe first time in her life--opened with a fulness, the thought of which\\nwould have covered poor Alice with misery and confusion if she could but\\nhave known what was passing in her companionâ\\x80\\x99s heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI had grown so tired of waiting,â\\x80\\x9d she said, scarcely aware of what she\\nsaid, â\\x80\\x9cI was wearying, wearying, as Mr. Lauderdale used to say; and to\\nthink you should be passing so near, and perhaps might have passed\\naltogether, and never have known I was here; Oh, Colin, it was\\nProvidence!â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, with the tears in her eyes.\\n\\nAnd poor Colin, who did not know what to say, whose heart was bursting\\nwith the profound pity and instinctive tenderness of old, and with that\\nsense that all his own imaginations were ended for ever, and his future\\ndecided for him without any action of his own--Colin could find no\\nanswer to make. He bent down again on the pale, soft hand which he held\\nin his own, and kissed it once more with that tender affection which was\\neverything in the world but love. â\\x80\\x9cYes,â\\x80\\x9d he said, but it was more to\\nhimself than to her, â\\x80\\x9cI think it was Providence.â\\x80\\x9d Alice had not an ear\\nthat could hear the despair that was in the words--for indeed it was a\\ndespair so mingled with softer emotions, with sympathy and anxiety, and\\na kind of fondness that nobody could have found it out who did not know\\nColin to the bottom of his heart. This was how the meeting was\\naccomplished after all those years; for by this time Lauderdale had\\nlooked at the view without seeing it, and was returning to see how his\\nfriend had gone through the encounter, and to claim Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s recognition\\nfor himself. The two spectators who approached from the window, where\\nthey had been pretending to look at the view, were, to tell the truth,\\nas much agitated as the young people themselves. Perhaps even, on the\\nwhole, a stranger, not knowing anything about the matter, would have\\nconcluded that it was Lauderdale and Mr. Meredith who were moved the\\nmost; for perhaps there is nothing which can happen to oneâ\\x80\\x99s self which\\nmoves one so profoundly as to watch a crisis of fate passing over\\nanother human creature whom one loves, yet whom one cannot die for or\\nsuffer for, and whose burden has to be borne, not by us, but by himself.\\nAliceâ\\x80\\x99s father, for his part, looked upon this meeting somehow as his\\nchildâ\\x80\\x99s last chance for life--or rather, it would be better to say, as\\nhis own last chance to save her life and preserve her to himself; and\\nLauderdale saw Colinâ\\x80\\x99s happiness, which was almost of more importance\\nthan his life, hanging upon the doubtful expression in the sick girlâ\\x80\\x99s\\neyes. When the two turned back, it was impossible to mistake the sweet\\njoy and serenity of Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s looks. Excitement was unnatural to her in\\nall circumstances. She had been agitated profoundly for a moment; but\\nnow all that was over, and the content of old had returned to her face.\\nThe same look that Lauderdale remembered at Frascati--the look which\\nalways greeted Colinâ\\x80\\x99s arrival--not any tumult of delight, but a supreme\\nsatisfaction and completeness, as if there remained nothing more in the\\nworld to be looked for or desired! She half rose up to meet her old\\nfriend as he came back to her, himself greatly moved, and not venturing\\nto look at Colin--and held out both her hands to him. â\\x80\\x9cOh Mr.\\nLauderdale, I have not told you how glad I am, nor how I have been\\n_wearying_â\\x80\\x9d--said Alice. She repeated that word--a word she had once\\nlaughed at--as if with a soft appeal to his recollection. She had said\\nit so often to herself in those long years--half because it was Scotch,\\nand pleased her yearning fancy; and half because there was a lingering\\ndepth of expression in it, like her long watch and vigil. And then she\\nsmiled in his face, and then cried a little. For, notwithstanding her\\ntranquillity, all this had tried her weakness, and proved a little more\\nthan she could bear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou must not agitate yourself, Alice,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith, taking, as\\nmost men do, the result of her past agitation for the thing itself. â\\x80\\x9cShe\\nis still a little weakly, but I hope now we shall soon see her strong\\nagain.â\\x80\\x9d This he said again with a covert glance at Colin, who was still\\nsitting close to the sofa with his face shaded by his hand.\\nNotwithstanding that shade the young man knew by instinct the look that\\nwas being directed upon him, and turned to meet it; and on his face\\nthere were greater marks of agitation than on that of Alice, which had\\nbeen relieved by her tears. He was pale, and to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s anxious\\neyes seemed to have fallen back from his vigour of manhood for the\\nmoment into that unassured youth which he had left behind him for years.\\nAnd then the voice of Mr. Meredith had an effect upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind\\naltogether different from that produced by the soft familiar tones of\\nAlice. When the father spoke, Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart shut fast its doors, and\\nrose up against the impending fate.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf Miss Meredith was ill,â\\x80\\x9d he said, with a little bitterness, taking at\\nleast advantage of the rights thus pressed back upon him to repulse this\\nman, whom he could not help disliking in his heart, â\\x80\\x9cI am surprised that\\nyou did not let me know.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThis speech was so unexpected and sudden, and there was in it such an\\namount of suppressed exasperation, that Lauderdale made a step forward\\nwithout knowing it, and Alice put out her hand vaguely to arrest the\\nvehemence of her betrothed. As for Mr. Meredith, he was as much\\nrelieved by the assumption of right in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s words, as he was\\ndisturbed by his unfriendly tone.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMy dear sir,â\\x80\\x9d said the father, â\\x80\\x9cI hope you will let bygones be bygones.\\nI have learned many severe lessons, and Providence has dealt with me in\\na way to make me see my errors; but I can safely say that, since I\\nunderstood the true state of the case, I have always reproached myself\\nfor not having shown the gratitude I felt to you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin, for his part, did not make any answer. His temper was disturbed\\nby the struggle he had been going through. He could not cry and get over\\nit, like Alice; being a man it was only in this way that he could give a\\nlittle vent to his feelings. And then he could relieve himself by\\nputting out some of his pain upon Mr. Meredith, without injury to her\\nwho had thus thrown herself undoubtingly upon his love, as she supposed.\\nPerhaps Bayard himself, under the same circumstances, would have done as\\nmuch.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI may say, my gratitude to both,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith, whose anxiety that\\nhe might not lose this chance for Alice was so great that it made him\\nalmost servile, and who could not help recollecting at that inopportune\\nmoment the letter he had written to Lauderdale; â\\x80\\x9cI know that Mr.\\nLauderdale also was very kind to my poor boy. I hope you will both\\nexcuse the error of the moment,â\\x80\\x9d he said, faltering a little. It was\\nhard to own himself altogether in the wrong, and yet in his anxiety he\\nwould have done even that for Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s sake.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSpeak no more of it,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cOur friend Arthur spoke of his\\nfather with his last breath, and weâ\\x80\\x99re no like to forget any of his\\nwords. Itâ\\x80\\x99s an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 consolation to my mind to see _her_ again, and to\\nfeel that weâ\\x80\\x99re aâ\\x80\\x99 friends. As for Colin, heâ\\x80\\x99s a wee out of himself, as\\nis natural. I would have been real vexed,â\\x80\\x9d said the philosopher, with\\nthe smile that was half tears, and that Alice remembered so well--â\\x80\\x9cbeing\\nsure of Arthur for a fast friend whenever we may meet again--to have\\nlost all sight and knowledge of you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe looked at Alice, but it was to Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s father that he held out his\\nhand; and, as for Colin, it was impossible for him not to follow the\\nexample, though he did it with a certain reluctance which did not escape\\nany of the spectators. And then they all made believe to be composed,\\nand at their ease, and began to talk, forming a little circle round\\nAliceâ\\x80\\x99s sofa, outside of which the little sister, with her eyes open to\\nthe widest extent, still stood, drinking in everything, and wondering\\nmuch what it could mean.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd, now that we have you,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith, â\\x80\\x9cwe cannot let you go\\nagain. You can go to Windermere, and any other place worth seeing, from\\nHolmby. You must tell me where to send for your things, and we will try\\nto make you comfortable here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWe have no things but those we carry with us,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cWe are\\npedestrians, and not fit for ladiesâ\\x80\\x99 society. I am afraid we must go\\nupon our dusty way--and return again,â\\x80\\x9d he added with an involuntary\\nglance at Alice. It was because he thought he was failing of his duty\\nthat he said these last words; but they were unnecessary so far as Alice\\nwas concerned, who had no suspicion, and, most likely, if she had known\\nhis secret, would not have understood it. It never could have entered\\nher head as a possible idea that he would thus have come to her again\\nand accepted his old position had he not loved her; and in her\\ntruthfulness she had the superiority over Colin--notwithstanding,\\nperhaps, that his motives were of a higher order, and his mode of\\nthinking more exalted than anything that could ever have come into her\\nhonest and simple mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOh, we can put up with your dress,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith, putting on a\\nheartiness that was scarcely natural to him. â\\x80\\x9cWe can be tolerant on that\\npoint. I will give orders directly about your rooms. Alice is not well\\nenough to see visitors, and your coats do not matter to her,â\\x80\\x9d he went on\\nwith a little laugh; not that he was merry, poor man, but that, like all\\nthe rest, he was agitated, and did not know how to give it vent. As for\\nAlice, she did not say anything, but she turned her soft eyes upon Colin\\nwith a look that seemed to caress him and his dusty vestments. If he had\\nbeen in the roughest peasantâ\\x80\\x99s dress, it would not have made any\\ndifference to Alice. Her soft, tranquil eyes rested upon him with that\\ncontent and satisfaction which convey the highest compliment that eyes\\nof woman can make to man. When he was there she had no longer any\\noccasion to look into the world, or seek further, and she could not but\\nsmile at the idea that his dusty coat mattered anything. Thus it was\\nthat everything was settled before Colin knew what was being done. The\\nsun was still high in the heavens when he found himself established at\\nHolmby, by Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s side, an inmate of her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s house; he who had got\\nup that morning with the idea that he was entirely sundered from his old\\nties, and that nothing in the world was so impossible as such a return\\nupon the past. Even now, when it had taken place, he could not believe\\nit was true, but sat as in a dream, and saw the fair shadow of the Alice\\nof Frascati moving and speaking like a phantom. Would it remain for\\never, looking at him with the soft eyes which he felt ashamed to meet,\\nand to which he could make so little response? A kind of despair came\\nover Colin as the slow afternoon waned, and the reality of the vision\\nbegan more and more to force itself upon him. Everything was so\\nfrightfully true and natural, and in reason. He had to baffle not only\\nthe eyes of Alice, but those of Lauderdale, who, he felt sure by\\ninstinct, was watching him, though he never could catch him in the act,\\nand put him down as of old by the broad, full, half-defiant look which\\nhe had learned was his best shield against all question. Lauderdale had\\ngrown too skilful to subject himself to that repulse; and yet Colin knew\\nthat his friend observed his smallest action, and heard every word he\\nwas saying, however distant he might be. And thus the day passed on in a\\nkind of distracting vision; and they all dined and talked, and looked,\\nas it is the duty of any party of people in England to look, exactly as\\nif they had been all their lives together, and it was the most natural\\nthing in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\n\\nThe evening passed on, Colin could not very well tell how; and he began\\nto see a prospect of escaping a little, and gaining a momentâ\\x80\\x99s breathing\\ntime, to realize, if he could, the astonishing revolution which had\\ntaken place. Alice, who was an invalid, retired early; and after that\\nthe conversation flagged, and the three men who had so little in common,\\nand who had been, on the sole occasion which had brought them into\\ncontact with each other before, so entirely in opposition, found it hard\\nto know what to say, so as to cultivate all the friendly feelings that\\nwere possible and dissipate the disagreeable reminiscences. Mr. Meredith\\nbetook himself to the only subject that seemed to him practicable--his\\nsonâ\\x80\\x99s book, which Colin had edited so carefully; but then it is already\\nknown to the readers of this history that Colinâ\\x80\\x99s opinions were by no\\nmeans those of the â\\x80\\x9cVoice from the Grave.â\\x80\\x9d And then the young man was\\nburning to escape--to get out of doors and feel the wind on his face,\\nand endeavour in the silence and darkness to realize his position. He\\nhad to escape not only from Mr. Meredith, who watched him with the\\nanxiety of a man who fears to see his last hope escape him, but also\\nfrom Lauderdale, who was concerned less for Alice than for Colin, and\\nwhose anxiety, now that his mind had been fully awakened, was as great\\nthat Colin should not risk his own happiness, as was Mr. Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s\\nanxiety that the happiness of Alice should be secured. Of the two, it\\nwas the latter whom Colin could meet with most ease; for it was in no\\nway necessary that he should open his heart to a man who sought him only\\nas he might have sought a physician; and, indeed, there was a certain\\nrelief to his mind in the expression of some irritation and resentment\\ntowards Mr. Meredith, who had once insulted him, and was friendly now\\nonly from the most interested motives. When he at last found it possible\\nto leave the room, and had actually opened the door to escape into the\\nopen air, it was Mr. Meredith who detained him. â\\x80\\x9cPardon me,â\\x80\\x9d he said;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbut, if you would but give me five minutes in my own room--I have a\\ngreat deal to say to you.â\\x80\\x9d Colin was obliged to yield, though his\\nimpatience was unspeakable; and he followed Mr. Meredith into the\\nlibrary, which, like all the other rooms in the house, was but partially\\nlighted. Here Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s father gave his guest a chair with solemnity, as\\nfor an important conference; and this was more than Colinâ\\x80\\x99s powers of\\nself-restraint could bear.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must ask you to pardon _me_,â\\x80\\x9d he said, putting his hand on the back\\nof the chair. â\\x80\\x9cYou will, perhaps, understand that all that has happened\\nto-day has disturbed my calculations a little. A man cannot go back four\\nyears of his life in so unexpected a way without feeling a little off\\nhis equilibrium. May I ask you to postpone till to-morrow what you have\\nto say?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOnly a moment--only three words,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith; â\\x80\\x9cI hope you have\\nforgiven me for the mistake which I have regretted ever since. I meant\\nno slight to you, whom I did not know. I was naturally excited to find\\nmy daughter in such circumstances; and, Mr. Campbell, I am sure you are\\ngenerous; you will not let a mere mistake prejudice you against me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was not a mistake,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin coldly; â\\x80\\x9cyou were right enough in\\neverything but the motives you imputed to me; and I am almost as poor a\\nman now as I was then, with very little chance of being richer--I may\\nsay with no chance,â\\x80\\x9d he went on, with a certain pleasure in exaggerating\\nhis disadvantages. â\\x80\\x9cA Scotch minister can make no advance in his\\nprofession. Instead of finding fault with what you did then, I feel\\ndisposed to bid you weigh well the circumstances now.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Meredith smiled, with a little air of protection, and drew a long\\nbreath of relief. â\\x80\\x9cAlice will have enough for both,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cand\\nProvidence has taught me by many severe lessons the vanity of riches.\\nShe will have enough for both.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt was at this moment that all the bitterness of the sacrifice he was\\nmaking rushed upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind--rushed upon him like a flood, quenching\\neven the natural courtesy of his disposition, and giving him a certain\\nsavage satisfaction in wreaking his vengeance upon the rich man, whose\\nriches he despised, and whose money smelt of spoliation and wrong. All\\nthe silent rage against his fate which possessed Colin--all the\\nreluctance and disappointment which a higher principle kept in abeyance\\nin presence of the innocent Alice--blazed up against her father in a\\nmomentary glare which appalled the victim. Colin might give up his ideal\\nand his dreams for tender friendship and honour and compassion; but the\\nidea of any sordid inducement mingled with these motives drove him the\\nlength of passion. It was, however, not with any noisy demonstration,\\nbut in a white heat of bitterness and angry resistance that he spoke.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt will be better that we should understand each other clearly on this\\npoint,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. â\\x80\\x9cI am not your judge, to say you have done well or\\nill; but it is a matter on which I may be permitted to have my own\\nopinion. I will not accept a shilling of your fortune. If Alice is\\ncontent to have me as I am, she shall have all the care, all the\\ntenderness that I can give her; but--pardon me, it is necessary to speak\\nplainly--I will take nothing from you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nColin stood up with his hand on the back of his chair, and delivered his\\ncharge full into the breast of his unsuspecting opponent. Perhaps it was\\ncruel; but there are circumstances under which it is a relief to be\\ncruel to somebody, and the pain in his soul found for itself a certain\\nexpression in these words. As for the unhappy victim who received them,\\nthe sense of surprise almost deadened the effect for the moment; he\\ncould not believe that he had heard rightly. Mr. Meredith was of the Low\\nChurch, and was used to say every day that wealth was vanity, and that\\nthe true treasure had to be laid up above; but still experience had not\\nshown him that poor young priests of any creed were generally so far\\nmoved by these sentiments as to despise the fortune which a wife might\\nbring them. He was so much amazed that he gave a gasp of consternation\\nat the young man who thus defied him, and grew not pale but grey with an\\nemotion which was more wonder than anger. Mr. Meredith was not a bad\\nman, notwithstanding that he had ruined several households, and made\\nhimself rich at other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s expense; and, even had he felt the full\\nforce of the insult personally, his anxiety about Alice would have made\\nhim bear it. That fatherly dread and love made him for the moment a\\ngreat deal more Christian than Colin, who had thus assaulted him in the\\nbitterness of his heart.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMr. Campbell,â\\x80\\x9d he replied, when he had sufficiently recovered himself\\nto speak, â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t know what you have heard about me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t mean to\\nenter upon any defence of myself. My poor boy, I know, misunderstood\\nsome transactions, not knowing anything about business. But, so far as I\\ncan see, that matters very little between you and me. I have explained\\nto you that my conduct in reference to yourself was founded on a\\nmistake. I have expressed my gratitude to you in respect to my son; and\\nnow, if we are to be more closely connected----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThat depends upon Miss Meredith,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, hastily. â\\x80\\x9cYou have opened\\nyour doors to me voluntarily, and not by my solicitation; and now it is\\nto _her_ that I have a right to address myself. Otherwise it would have\\nbeen better if you had not asked me to come here.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Meredith. He thought he saw a doubtful gleam in\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s eye, and an accent of repugnance in his voice, and he trembled\\nto the bottom of his heart lest perhaps, after all, he might lose this\\nchance of preserving his daughter. â\\x80\\x9cYes, yes,â\\x80\\x9d he said with a smile,\\nwhich it cost him a little trouble to assume, and which looked horribly\\nout of place to Colin; â\\x80\\x9cI ought to have learned by this time that it\\ndoes not do to interfere between lovers. I allow that it lies entirely\\nbetween her and you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nHe might have said a great deal more if his young hearer would have\\ngiven him time; but Colin was only too glad to escape. The word â\\x80\\x9cloversâ\\x80\\x9d\\nwhich Mr. Meredith used, the smile which he was so far from meaning, the\\nlighter tone which belied his feelings quite as much as Colinâ\\x80\\x99s, drove\\nthe young man half frantic with impatience and disgust. At last he\\nmanaged to get his will, and escaped out of doors, with the cigar which\\nwas an excuse for his thoughts. The night was dark, and agitated by a\\nghostly wind, and the country, utterly unknown, which lay round the\\nhouse in the darkness, and which neither memory nor imagination\\npresented to the mind of the stranger, increased the natural effect of\\nthe gloom and the solitude. He went down through the long straight\\nopening of the avenue, which was a little less black than the\\nsurrounding world, with a sensation of loneliness which was as strange\\nas it was painful. He did not seem to know himself or his life\\nhenceforward any more than he knew the wild, strange country over which\\nthe night and the wind ruled supreme. It seemed to him as if the solace\\nof friendship, the consolation of sympathy, were all ended for ever; he\\ncould not talk, even to those who were most dear to him, of his\\nbetrothed, or of his marriage--if, indeed, that was what it must come\\nto. He had walked up and down the avenue two or three times, from one\\nend to another, before even a little coherence came to his thoughts. All\\nwas so strange and unbelievable as yet; so like a trick of magic played\\nupon him by some malign magician. He was not capable of thinking; but\\neverything passed before him like a vision, appearing and disappearing\\nout of the darkness. His old freedom, his impulses of revolution, the\\nforce and fulness of life with which he was young enough to sport, even\\nin its most serious strength, and all the sweet wealth of imagination\\nthat had lain hoarded up for him among the clouds--these were things\\nthat belonged to yesterday. To-night it was another world that seemed to\\nlie before him in the gloom, a separate sphere from the actual world in\\nwhich he was standing. Vague limitations and restrictions which he could\\nnot identify were awaiting him; and he saw no way of escaping, and yet\\ndid not know how he was to bear the future thraldom.\\n\\nAs this ferment calmed down a little, Colin began to think of Alice,\\nsweet and patient, and dutiful as she always was. He even resented, for\\nher sake, his own indifference and repugnance, and said bitterly to\\nhimself that it was hard that such a woman should be accepted as a\\nnecessary burden, and not longed for as a crown of blessing; but yet,\\nwith all that, he could not cheat his own heart, or persuade himself\\nthat he wanted to marry her, or that it was less than the sacrifice of\\nall his individual hopes to enter again upon the old relationship, and\\nfulfil the youthful bond. When, however, he attempted to ask himself if\\nhe could escape, the same heart which sank at the thought of this bond\\nbaffled and stopped him in his question. He would not harm _her_, should\\nit kill him.\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cHe loved her with all love, except the love\\n     Of men and women when they love the best.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd it was he himself who had knitted in youthful generosity and\\nindiscretion the chain that now lay on his limbs like iron. Alice had\\ndone nothing unmaidenly, nothing that in all honour and delicacy she\\nought not to have done. To be sure, another man as honourable as Colin\\nmight have given her to understand, or permitted her to find out, the\\nchange which had taken in his sentiments. But Colin could not even\\nassert with any truth that his sentiments had changed. For he was almost\\nas conscious that she was not the woman of his imagination when he led\\nher home from the ilex avenue on the day which determined their fortunes\\nas he was now after the long separation which had not broken the link\\nbetween them. He had known in his heart that it was not broken, even\\nwhen he had most felt his freedom; and now what could he do? Perhaps\\nthat morning, after the carriage had passed him, after the little cry of\\nrecognition which convinced his heart, but which his mind could still\\nhave struggled against, he might have turned back as he had once thought\\nof doing, and fled ignominiously. But that moment was past, and there\\nwas nothing to be done but accept the results of his own youthful\\nrashness. Such were the thoughts that went through his mind as he walked\\nup and down the avenue between the two long lines of trees, hearing the\\nwind roar among the branches overhead, and feeling that henceforward\\nthere must always be a secret in his heart, something which nobody must\\ndiscover, a secret which neither now nor any time could be breathed into\\nany sympathetic ear. This sense of something to conceal weighed harder\\nupon Colin than if it had been a crime--for there is no crime so\\nterrible but a human creature may entertain the hope some time of\\nrelieving his mind of it, and breathing it into the ear of some\\nconfidant, consecrated either by love or religion, who will not shrink\\nfrom him in consequence of that revelation. The sting of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s burden\\nwas that he could never relieve himself of it, that all the questions\\nraised by it must absolutely confine themselves to his own mind, and\\nmust lie unnamed and even unsuggested between him and those friends from\\nwhom he had never hidden anything but this.\\n\\nAll this he revolved in his mind as he contemplated his position. So far\\nfrom seeking sympathy, it would be his business to refuse and ignore it,\\nshould it be given by any implication, and to seek congratulations,\\nfelicitations, instead. All this he was going to do for Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s sake;\\nand yet he did not love Alice. He looked up at a faintly-lighted window,\\nwhere there seemed to be a shaded light as in an invalidâ\\x80\\x99s room, and\\nthought of her with a mixture of bitterness and sweetness, of tender\\naffection and unconquerable reluctance, of loyalty almost fantastic and\\nthe most painful sense of hardship, which it would be impossible to\\ndescribe. She, for her part, was lying down to rest with her heart full\\nof the sweetest content and thankfulness, thinking with thoughts so\\ndifferent from his how her life had changed since the morning, and how\\nthe almost-forgotten sunshine had come back again, to remain for ever.\\nThis was how Alice was looking at the matter, and Colin knew it in his\\nheart. If she could but wake out of that soft paradise to see the\\ndarkness and the turmoil in his mind! But that was what she must never\\nfind out.\\n\\nAnd thus Colin made up his mind, if he could ever be said to have had\\nany doubt in his mind, as to what was to be done. He did not even cheat\\nhimself by the hope that anything could happen to deliver him. It was\\nProvidence, as Alice had said. Perhaps it might come darkly into the\\nyoung manâ\\x80\\x99s mind to wonder whether those severe lessons which Mr.\\nMeredith said he had had in his family--whether all those fatal losses\\nand sorrows which Alice regarded with awe, yet with a certain devout\\nadmiration as Godâ\\x80\\x99s mysterious way of bringing about her own happiness,\\ncould be designed to effect an end which did not make him happy; for, in\\nsuch a question, personal content or dissatisfaction has a great deal to\\ndo with the way in which a man regards the tenor of Providence. Had he\\nbeen as happy as Alice was, perhaps he too would have concluded that\\nthis was but another instance how all things work together for good.\\nBut, as he was not happy, he plunged into a world of more painful\\nquestions, and returned again as before, after his favourite\\nspeculations had beguiled him for a little out of the immediate matter\\nin hand, to realize, as if by a flash of lightning, all the facts of the\\ncase, and all the necessities before him. There may be many people who\\nwill condemn Colin both for remaining indifferent to Alice, and for\\nremaining faithful to her in his indifference. But this is not a defence\\nnor eulogium of him, but simply a history. It was thus his mind acted\\nunder the circumstances. He could conduct himself only according to his\\nown nature; and this is all that there is to say.\\n\\nAll this time Lauderdale was standing at his window, watching in the\\ndarkness for an occasional glimpse of something moving among the trees.\\nHe had put out his light by instinct, that Colin might not think he was\\nbeing watched. He kept looking out upon the wild tree-tops swaying about\\nin the wind, and upon the wilder clouds, dashed and heaped about the\\nsky, with a great sadness in his heart. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s nature was not like his;\\nyet by dint of a sympathy which had been expanding and growing with the\\nyoung manâ\\x80\\x99s growth, and a knowledge of him and his ways, which no one in\\nthe world possessed to the same extent, Lauderdale had very nearly\\ndivined what was in his friendâ\\x80\\x99s heart. He divined at the same time that\\nhe must never divine it, nor betray by word or look that such an idea\\nhad ever entered his mind. And that was why he put his light out, and,\\nwatching long till Colin had come in, said his prayers in the dark, and\\nwent to rest without seeking any communication with him, though his\\nheart was yearning over him. It was Colin, and not Lauderdale, who was\\nthe hero of that silent struggle. Yet perhaps there was no single pang\\nin the young manâ\\x80\\x99s suffering so exquisite as that which thrilled through\\nhis companion as he resigned himself to an appearance of repose, and\\ndenied himself so much as a look at his friend, to whom he had been like\\na father. At such a moment a look might have been a betrayal; and now it\\nwas Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s business to second Colinâ\\x80\\x99s resolution--to avoid all\\nconfidence, and to save him even from himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n\\nAfter this agitated night the morning came, as morning has a knack of\\ncoming, with that calm freshness and _insouciance_ which exasperates a\\nmind in distress. What does Nature care about what happened last night\\nor may happen to-morrow? If she had disturbed herself for such trifles,\\nshe must have died of it in her first thousand years. The new day, on\\nthe contrary, was as gay and as easy in her mind as if in all the world\\nthere were no painful puzzles awaiting her, and no inheritance of\\nyesterday to be disposed of. Somehow the sight of that fresh and joyous\\nlight recalled to Colin the looks of the fair spring mornings in Italy,\\nwhich used to burst in upon Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s deathbed with what always seemed to\\nhim a look of careless surprise and inquiry. But Alice for her part\\nfound a tender sweetness in the new day. All that was bright in nature\\ncame and paid court to her by reason of her happiness--for there is no\\nfairweather friend so frank in her intruded intentions as Nature, though\\nit is happiness and not grandeur to which she attaches herself. Alice\\nwent down to breakfast that morning, which she had not been able to do\\nfor a long time. She had laid aside her black dress by instinct, and\\nput on a white one, which had nothing but its black ribbons to mark it\\nas mourning; and there was a little delicate colour on her cheek, and\\nher eyes, though a little too large and clear, had a glimmer of sunshine\\nin them, like the light in a dewdrop. Colin would have been hardhearted\\nindeed, had he refused to be moved by that tender revival of health and\\nhope, which was owing to him solely; and his friends are aware that\\nColin was not hardhearted. He was, perhaps, even more thoughtful of her,\\nmore devoted to her, than he would have been had the timidity of real\\nlove been upon him. When the breakfast was over--and naturally there was\\nstill a certain embarrassment upon the party so abruptly united, and\\nmade up of elements so unlike each other--Colin and Alice were left\\ntogether. He proposed to her to go out, and they went out, for Alice had\\nforgotten all about the precautions which the day before were so\\nnecessary for her. They went into the avenue, where the daylight and the\\nsunshine had tamed down the wind into a cheerful breeze. Nothing of the\\nlandscape outside was to be seen from that sheltered enclosure--no more\\nthan could have been seen through the close shade of the ilexes at\\nFrascati, which they were both thinking of as they strayed along under\\nthe shadow of the trees; but the stately elms and green transparent lime\\nleaves which shadowed the avenue of Holmby were as unlike as could be\\nsupposed to the closely woven sombre green which shut out the\\noverwhelming sunshine in the grounds of the Villa Conti. Here the sun\\nwas very supportable, to say the truth; there was no occasion to shut it\\nout, and even when a great tree came in the way, and interfered with it,\\na little shiver came over Alice. And yet it was June, the same month in\\nwhich they had wandered through the ilex cloister, and watched the span\\nof blue sky blazing at the end, the only indication visible that the\\ngreat shining glowing world lay outside. Colin was so full of\\nrecollections, so full of thoughts, that at first he could find but\\nlittle to say; and, as for Alice, her content did not stand in need of\\nany words to express it. Nor could any words have expressed, on the\\nother hand, the profound remorseful tenderness, almost more tender than\\nlove itself, with which Colin bent over her, and held her supported on\\nhis arm.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you remember the ilexes in the Villa Conti?â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt was about\\nthis time, was it not?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIt was on the second of June,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, hastily. She was half vexed\\nthat the day had not been marked by him as by her. â\\x80\\x9cOh, yes, I remember\\nevery twig, I think,â\\x80\\x9d she said, with a smile. â\\x80\\x9cThe second of June was on\\na Sunday this year. I think I cried nearly all day, for it seemed as if\\nyou never would come. And not to know where you were, or how you were,\\nall these four dreary, dreary years!----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWhat could Colin do? He pressed the hand that clung to his arm, and\\nanswered as he best could, touched ever more and more with that\\ntenderness of remorse towards the woman who loved him. â\\x80\\x9cYou know it was\\nnot any fault of mine. It was your father who sent me away.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYes, I know,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice; â\\x80\\x9cit was that always that kept me up, for I\\nknew _you_ would not change. Poor papa! he has had such dreadful\\nlessons. Mrs. Meredith, you know, and the poor little children! I used\\nto think, if God would only have taken me, and left them who were so\\nhappy----â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd here there was a little pause, for Alice had some tears to brush\\naway, and Colin, ever more and more touched, could not but offer such\\nconsolations as were natural under the circumstances. And it was Alice\\nwho resumed at length, with the simple certainty natural to her mind.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI see now that it was all for the best,â\\x80\\x9d she said; â\\x80\\x9cGod has been so\\ngood to us. Oh, Colin, is it not true about His mysterious ways?--and\\nthat everything works together for good, though it may seem hard at the\\ntime.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPerhaps Colin found it difficult to answer this question; perhaps, not\\nbeing absorbed by his own happiness, he could not but wonder over again\\nif poor Mrs. Meredith and her children who were dead, would have seen\\nthat working of Providence in the same light as Alice did. But then this\\nwas not a subject to be discussed between two lovers; and, if it was not\\nProvidence who had seized upon him in the midst of his thoughtless\\nholiday, and brought him back to the bonds of his youth, and changed all\\nhis prospects in the twinkling of an eye, what was it? Not the heathen\\nFate, taking a blind vengeance upon Folly, which was a harder thing to\\nthink of than the ways, however mysterious, of God. These were not\\nthoughts to be passing through a manâ\\x80\\x99s mind at such a moment; and Colin\\navoided the answer which was expected of him, and plunged into more\\nurgent affairs.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI must go away,â\\x80\\x9d he said; â\\x80\\x9cdo not look reproachful, Alice. I do not\\nmean to continue my holiday after this. It seems to me we have waited a\\ngreat deal too long already,â\\x80\\x9d Colin went on with a smile, which he felt\\nto be forced, but which had no such effect upon Alice. â\\x80\\x9cNow that the\\nobstacles are removed I cannot consent to any longer delay; and you\\nknow I have a house to take you to now, which I had not in the old\\ntimes.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cYou had always Ramore,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice; and the way in which she said it\\nproved to him still once more that, though he had put her out of his\\nmind, Alice had forgotten nothing he had ever said to her. She spoke of\\nthe farmerâ\\x80\\x99s homely house not as of a place which she heard some vague\\ntalk of so many years ago, but as a home for which she had been longing.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cAnd your mother!â\\x80\\x9d said Alice; â\\x80\\x9cif you had the most beautiful house in\\nthe world, I want you to take me there first of all; I want you to take\\nme to her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt will be seen from this that Alice did not think there was anything to\\nbe deprecated in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s haste. She accepted it as most reasonable, and\\nthe thing that was to be looked for. She thought it natural that he\\nshould be reluctant to lose sight of her again, as she, for her part,\\nwas very reluctant to lose sight of him; and thus they went on to make\\nall their necessary arrangements. In this close and tender interview, as\\nhe saw ever more and more how Alice depended upon him, how real the link\\nbetween them had been to her even during those long years of separation,\\nand how, in her perfect good faith and simplicity, she considered him,\\nand all belonging to him, as hers, Colin himself came to consider it the\\nmost natural and unquestionable conclusion. The pain in his heart\\nsoftened, his reluctance seemed to melt away. Alice had more beauty at\\nthis time of her life than ever she had had before. Her weakness, and\\nthe charm of that hidden love which had been so long working in her, and\\nwhich had now brightened into the fullest blossom, had given an\\nexpression hitherto wanting to her eyes. She was more individual and\\ndistinct by right of having kept and hoarded that individual attachment\\nin her heart, in defiance of everything that could be done against it;\\nand now in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s presence, believing as she did with that confidence\\nwhich can be born only of love, in his entire interest in everything\\nconnected with her, her timidity disappeared, and she hourly gained\\ninterest and character. All this had its effect upon Colin so long as\\nthe two were together straying through the avenue, crossing the bars of\\nshade and the rays of sunshine, listening to the birds singing overhead\\nand to the rustle of the summer leaves. But it was harder work when they\\nwent indoors again, when Mr. Meredithâ\\x80\\x99s anxious face appeared, and the\\ngrave countenance of Lauderdale, carefully cleared of all anxiety, and\\nbecome, so far as that was possible, altogether inexpressive. Colin was\\nof so uncertain a mood that the very absence of all question in\\nLauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s eyes jarred upon him, though he could not have borne to be\\ninterrogated. He was high-fantastical beyond all previous precedent at\\nthat moment; and the readers of this history are aware that already, at\\nvarious periods of his life, it had happened to him to be fantastical\\nenough. The conversation and confidences of the avenue broke clean off\\nwhen the party were all assembled within. Alice could not say anything\\nbefore her father of her weariness and waiting, or it would have sounded\\nlike a reproach; and Colin, for his part, could not utter a word about\\nhis intentions or prospects to any ears but hers. He could speak to her,\\nand she, who accepted everything said without any question, found\\nnothing wanting in his words; and that was already a new link between\\nthem; but before her father and his own friend he was dumb. He could not\\neven talk to Lauderdale as he had talked to him four years ago at\\nFrascati; and yet he resented that Lauderdale did not ask him any\\nquestions. From which it will be seen that nothing could well be less\\nmanageable and reasonable than the state of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mind at this moment,\\nwhen the most important decision of his life was being made.\\n\\nThat evening it was he who sought an interview with Mr. Meredith. It was\\nvery clear, in every point of view, that everything should be arranged\\nwith the least delay possible. â\\x80\\x9cI have served half as long as Jacob\\ndid,â\\x80\\x9d Colin said, with a smile, which, however, was far from being the\\nradiant smile of a happy lover; and Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s father, who was not by any\\nmeans so confident of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s love as Alice was, was so much concerned\\nthat his daughter should not lose the happiness which meant not only\\nhappiness but life and strength as well, that he did not venture to make\\nany objections. Neither did the poor man resent the insult, when Colin\\nrepeated with mildness, yet with steadiness, his determination to\\nreceive nothing from him. Alice had something of her own, which came to\\nher from her mother, the little revenue which Arthur had once had his\\nshare of, and on which the two had lived at Frascati: but beyond that,\\nColin, always superlative, would have none of the rich manâ\\x80\\x99s fortune,\\nwhich was soiled, as he thought, with fraud and cruelty. Whether this\\naccusation was just or unjust, poor Mr. Meredith, who was a kind father,\\nswallowed it without saying anything, and consented to all his future\\nson-in-lawâ\\x80\\x99s requirements. Colin had made up his mind to leave Holmby at\\nonce, to hasten back to Afton, and make all the preparations necessary\\nto receive his bride; and the marriage was fixed to take place very\\nshortly--in August, when Colin could take up again his broken thread of\\nholiday. All this was arranged between the two as an absolute matter of\\nbusiness, requiring no expression of sentiment. If Mr. Meredith thought\\nthe young man a little cold and stern, and swallowed that sentiment as\\nhe had swallowed the other, after all, perhaps, it was best that in\\ndiscussing what was a business matter even a bridegroom should talk in a\\nbusiness way. And, then, Alice was unquestionably satisfied, and had\\nregained some colour on her cheek, and some elasticity in her step. She\\nhad never been consumptive, like Arthur. Her illness was a kind of\\nhopelessness, a lingering languor, which was quite as capable of killing\\nher as if it had been a legitimate disease; and this was a malady from\\nwhich, to all appearance, only Colin and a happy life could deliver her.\\nUnder these circumstances, therefore, it was natural that Mr. Meredith,\\nthough a little wounded, and even a little alarmed, by the new\\nson-in-law, who meant to have everything his own way, consented to his\\nwishes, being anxious, above all things, to preserve his daughter. He\\ncaressed and petted Alice all the more when his consent had been made\\nknown to her, with a kind of faint idea, in his ignorance, that all the\\nindulgences which had surrounded her would be at an end when she put\\nherself under the power of this abrupt and imperious young man. As for\\nAlice, she looked from her father to her betrothed with a serenity and\\nconfidence so profound that it went to Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart. â\\x80\\x9cShe has been used\\nto be taken care of all her life,â\\x80\\x9d her father said, as fathers generally\\nsay, but with an odd forgetfulness, for the moment, that Colin knew\\nsomething about that. â\\x80\\x9cI hope you will be very good to her.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAlice opened her soft lips at this, to give vent to a little ring of\\nlaughter so soft that it did not wound even the fantastical delicacy of\\nher Bayard. To doubt Colin seemed to her not so much wrong as absurd,\\nout of all reason. She said, half under her breath, â\\x80\\x9cHe has taken care\\nof me before nowâ\\x80\\x9d--and, to relieve herself of that which she could not\\nexpress to her father without blaming him, it was to Lauderdale she\\nturned. â\\x80\\x9cYou made me feel as if I were a princess,â\\x80\\x9d she said to him, and\\nheld out her hand to the friend who was looking on with an anxiety so\\nintense that it precluded speech. As for Colin, in the high state of\\nirritation in which he was, the very silence with which Lauderdale\\npressed the little hand of Alice between his own aggravated and\\nexasperated him. Why did not he say something? Why did he not look him,\\nthe bridegroom, straight in the eyes, and ask, â\\x80\\x9cAre not you happy?â\\x80\\x9d Had\\nhe done so, Colin would have taken it as the direst and most\\nunpardonable offence; but, in the disturbed state of his heart and mind,\\nhe resented the very absence of the question. A man must have some one\\nto bear the brunt of his discontent when things go wrong with him, and\\nin the meantime there was nobody but Lauderdale to take this necessary\\npart.\\n\\nAccordingly, when all was settled, and when it was finally arranged that\\nColin should leave Holmby next morning and make haste home, to commence\\nhis preparations, it was of his own accord that he invited Lauderdale to\\njoin him in the avenue for half an hourâ\\x80\\x99s talk. The wind had fallen, and\\nthe night was very still, but it was almost as dark as on the previous\\nevening, and the gloom had this advantage, that they could not see each\\notherâ\\x80\\x99s faces, which was all the better under the circumstances. They\\nhad walked almost all the length of the avenue before Colin spoke, and\\nthen it was to this effect.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cLauderdale, look here. I am going home, and leaving you in the lurch.\\nWe are not going to Windermere together, as we meant to do. You see, I\\nhave things more important in hand. What I want to say is, that you are\\nnot to think yourself bound by me. I see no reason why you should return\\nbecause a--a good fortune so unexpected has come to me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you mean that you want me to go my ways?â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. â\\x80\\x9cWith me\\nthere is little need to speak in parables. Say plain out if you would\\nrather be your lane. I am no a man to take offence--not from you.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, in his impatience, â\\x80\\x9cwhy should you or any\\none take offence? What I tell you is the plainest statement of the case.\\nI have to go home, but you are not obliged to go home. And why should\\nyou break off your excursion for me?â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cIf I was minding about the excursion,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale, â\\x80\\x9cI would go on.\\nYou aye make so much account of yourselves, you callants. As for\\nWindermere, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no bigoted, but if itâ\\x80\\x99s mair worth seeing than our ain\\nlochs it would be a wonder to me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no for parting company. Itâ\\x80\\x99s aye\\nbeen my way of thinking, that even a railroad, seen with four een, was\\nbetter than the bonniest country in the world, seen with two only. Weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\ngo hame, Colin, if you have no objections, you and me.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAnd then there was a silence, and the two friends went on together side\\nby side in the darkness, without a word to each other. Between them the\\nordinary words of congratulation would have sounded like mockery, and\\nthe one divined too clearly the condition of the other to know what to\\nsay. Lauderdale, however, knew Colin so well that he knew silence to be\\nas dangerous as speech.\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI have an awfuâ\\x80\\x99 desire in my mind,â\\x80\\x9d he said at length; â\\x80\\x9cno doubt itâ\\x80\\x99s\\ndaftlike, but that is no extraordinary. I would like to do something\\nwith my hands to please her, now weâ\\x80\\x99ve found her. Iâ\\x80\\x99m no rich, and,\\nwhatâ\\x80\\x99s an awful deal worse, Iâ\\x80\\x99m no much for anything but talk--and maybe\\nshe has an inkling of that. What was that yon lad Browning says about\\nRaphaelâ\\x80\\x99s sonnets and Danteâ\\x80\\x99s picture? Iâ\\x80\\x99m of that opinion myselâ\\x80\\x99. I\\nwould like to do something with my hands that was nae fit work for the\\nlike of me, just to please her; if it was naething better than the\\nthings they whittle with their knives away yonder among the Alps,â\\x80\\x9d said\\nLauderdale; and even in the darkness Colin could see the little flourish\\nof his arm with which he had the habit of indicating the\\nnever-to-be-forgotten region â\\x80\\x9caway yonder.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cHave patience a moment till\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve done speaking,â\\x80\\x9d he went on; â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking I would like to\\ntake a good dayâ\\x80\\x99s work at the Manse garden. Itâ\\x80\\x99s as innocent a thing in\\nits way to plant flowers as to write verses. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying Iâ\\x80\\x99ll go home\\nwith you, if youâ\\x80\\x99ve nae objections,â\\x80\\x9d said Lauderdale. He came to a\\nconclusion so suddenly, that Colin, who had gradually yielded to the\\ninfluence of the familiar tranquillising voice, came to a sudden pause\\nwhen he stopped short. Lauderdale paused too in his walk when his friend\\ndid so, though without knowing why. It was indifferent to him whether he\\nkept walking or stood still; his mind went on pursuing its leisurely\\nmeditations all the same.\\n\\nBut Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart was full. He grasped Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s arm without knowing\\nit, with that sudden impulse of saying something which sometimes comes\\nupon people who must not say what is in their hearts. â\\x80\\x9cCome!â\\x80\\x9d he said,\\nwith a little choking in his voice, â\\x80\\x9cwe will do that dayâ\\x80\\x99s work\\ntogether; for I suppose there never was gain, however great, but had\\nloss in it,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin. Perhaps he did not know very well himself what\\nhe meant, but even these vague words were a little ease to him in their\\nway. And then they went indoors, and the long day came to an end.\\n\\nThis was how the holiday excursion terminated. They left Holmby next\\nmorning, and went home again; neither one nor the other thinking any\\nmore of the Church Reformation, or of the â\\x80\\x9cTracts for the Times.â\\x80\\x9d When\\nColin found his MS. in his writing-case when he opened it on the night\\nof his arrival at Ramore to write to Alice, he looked at it with a\\nlittle wonder, as if it had been a fossil of an early formation\\nunexpectedly disinterred among the fragments of daily use and wont. And\\nthen he returned it to his pocket, with something that looked like a\\nvery clumsy attempt at a smile. There are points of view from which a\\ngood-sized tree or a shepherdâ\\x80\\x99s cottage may blot out a mountain; and\\neverybody knows how easily that is accomplished on the moral horizon,\\nwhere a tiny personal event can put the greatest revolution in the\\nbackground. It would be too long to tell the wonder and admiration and\\nperplexed joy of the Mistress when she heard of the accident which had\\nput an end to her sonâ\\x80\\x99s journey. Her joy was perplexed, because there\\nwas always a shadow which she could not decipher upon Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\ncountenance; and, even if her motherâ\\x80\\x99s pride would have permitted her to\\nconsult Lauderdale on such a subject, or to suffer either him or herself\\nto suppose for a moment that he could know more about her boy than she\\ndid, Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s lips were sealed. Colin stayed only a night at Ramore\\nto let his family know what was going to happen, and then he hurried to\\nAfton, still accompanied by his friend. They talked of almost everything\\nin the world during that journey, except of the preparations they were\\ngoing to make, and the change that was to follow; but Colinâ\\x80\\x99s great\\nambition, and the important changes he meant to work in his native\\nChurch and country, had little part in their discussions. At such a\\nmoment, when it is next to impossible to a man to talk of what he is\\nthinking of, it is such a wonderful relief for him to escape into\\nmetaphysics; and, fortunately, in that department of human\\ninvestigation, there are still so many questions to discuss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\n\\nIf this had been anything but a true history, it would have been now the\\ntime for Alice Meredith to overhear a chance conversation, or find a\\ndropped letter, which would betray to her Colinâ\\x80\\x99s secret; but this is\\nnot an accident with which the present historian can give interest to\\nhis closing chapter, because, in the first place, it did not happen;\\nand, in the second, if a second should be thought necessary, because\\nColin had never confided his secret either to writing or to any mortal\\near--which is of all ways of securing a private matter the most\\ncertain. He thought to himself, with a certain inexpressible content, as\\nhe put his manse in order to receive her, that never to any living\\ncreature, never even to the air that might have repeated the matter, had\\nhe so much as whispered what was the real foundation of the old\\nbetrothals, which were now about to be carried out. He had never been so\\nnear telling it as on the night before Alice reappeared in his\\nlife--that moment when the words were half formed on his lips, and\\nnothing but a chivalrous, visionary sense of the respect he owed to a\\nwoman had prevented him putting an end to Lauderdaleâ\\x80\\x99s recollections by\\na confession which would have closed his friendâ\\x80\\x99s lips for ever.\\nFortunately he had been saved from that danger; and now no one, even in\\nthe depths of his heart, could say or feel that Alice had been ever\\nregarded by her husband otherwise than as the chosen of a manâ\\x80\\x99s heart,\\nthe companion of his existence, should be regarded. He had by times a\\nhard enough struggle during these intervening weeks, when he took refuge\\nin his study at Afton, in the midst of the disorganized house, where\\nthings were being prepared for the arrival of his wife; and in her\\ngarden, where Lauderdale had done more than a dayâ\\x80\\x99s work, and had,\\nindeed, taken the charge of re-arrangement into his hands. But the\\ngarden, in those lingering, never-ending summer twilights, full of\\nnorthern sweetness, was too much for Colin; when the early stars came\\nout on the skirts of the slow departing day, they seemed to cast\\nreproachful glances at him, as if he had abandoned that woman in the\\nclouds. He used to go in with a sigh, and shut himself up in his study,\\nand light his candles; and then, after all, it was a great good fortune\\nthat she had never come down out of the wistful distance, and walked\\nupon the common soil, and looked him in the face. As for Alice, if\\nanybody had betrayed to her the exact state of affairs, if she had been\\nmade aware of this mysterious and invisible rival, towards whom, in the\\ndepths of his heart, Colin sighed, the chances are that she would only\\nhave laughed, in the supreme security of her ignorance. She could no\\nmore have understood the rivalry there was in that dream than she could\\nhave comprehended any other or better description of love than that\\nwhich her betrothed gave her. For the fact is, that nobody need in the\\nleast bemoan Alice, or think that her position was one to call for\\nsympathy. She was perfectly content, knowing so little of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s heart\\nas she did, and she would still have been perfectly content had she\\nknown it much more profoundly. If he had regarded her as he could have\\nregarded his ideal woman, Alice would not have understood, and probably\\neven would have been embarrassed and made uneasy by, such devotion. She\\nhad all that she had ever dreamed of in the way of love. Her ideal, such\\nas it was, was fully realized. Colinâ\\x80\\x99s tenderness, which had so much\\nremorse in it, was to Alice the most perfect of all manifestations of\\nattachment. When his heart was full of compunctions for not giving her\\nenough, hers was swelling with the sweetest pride and satisfaction in\\nreceiving so much. It even seemed to her odd by times how a man so\\nsuperior should be so fond of her, as she said to herself, in her\\ninnocence: for, to be sure, Arthur, though he was not equal to Colin,\\nhad given but a very limited consideration to his little sister. And her\\nsense of the difference between Arthurâ\\x80\\x99s estimation of her and the rank\\nshe held with her betrothed was like the sweetest flattery to her mind.\\nAnd Alice had reason in these conclusions of hers. She described Colinâ\\x80\\x99s\\naffection perfectly well in her simple words. It was as true to say he\\nwas fond of her, as it was that he did not love her according to his\\nestimate of love. But then his estimate of love was not hers, and she\\nwas entirely content.\\n\\nThus it came about that these two were married after all the long delay\\nand separation. Alice recovered her health by magic as soon as she began\\nto be happy. And Mr. Meredith, notwithstanding that he smarted a little\\nunder the affront put upon him by his new son-in-law, in that singular\\nand quite original development of disinterestedness, which Aliceâ\\x80\\x99s\\nfather, being Low Church, could not but think most unlike a\\nclergyman--was yet so exhilarated by the unrivalled success of his\\nexpedient to save his daughter, that all the lesser annoyances were\\nswallowed up. And then he had always the little one remaining, whom he\\ncould make an heiress of. It was a quiet wedding--for the Merediths were\\ncomparatively strangers in Westmoreland--but, at the same time, it was\\nnot in the least a sad one, for Mr. Meredith did not think of weeping,\\nand there was nobody else to take that part of the business. Alice had\\nonly her little sister to leave, who was too much excited and delighted\\nwith all the proceedings, and with her own future position as Miss\\nMeredith, to be much overcome by the parting. It was, indeed, a\\nbeginning of life almost entirely without drawbacks to the bride. She\\nhad nothing much to regret in the past, no links of tender affection to\\nbreak, and no sense of a great blank left behind, as some young women\\nhave. On the contrary, all that was dark and discouraging was left\\nbehind. The most exquisite moments of her life, the winter she had\\nspent in Frascati under the tender and chivalrous guardianship of the\\ncompanions who had devoted all their powers to console and amuse\\nArthurâ\\x80\\x99s sister, seemed but an imperfect rehearsal, clouded with pain\\nand sorrow, for the perfect days that were to come. â\\x80\\x9cI wish for nothing\\nbut Sora Antonia to bid God bless us,â\\x80\\x9d she said with the tears of her\\nespousals in her eyes. And it was the best thing Alice could have said.\\nThe idyll for which Colin felt himself so poor a hero now, had existed,\\nin a way, among the pale olive-groves, on the dear Alban hills. â\\x80\\x9c_Dio te\\nBenedica!_â\\x80\\x9d he said, as he took away his bride from her fatherâ\\x80\\x99s door.\\nIt meant more than a blessing, when he said it as Sora Antonia might\\nhave said it, in that language which was consecrated to them both by\\nlove and death.\\n\\nThe scene and the circumstances were all very different when a few weeks\\nlater Colin took his bride to the Holy Loch. It was evening, but perhaps\\nColin had not time for the same vivid perceptions of that twilight and\\npeaceful atmosphere which a few months before had made him smile,\\ncontrasting it with the movement and life in his own mind. But perhaps\\nthis was only because he was more occupied by external matters; by Alice\\nat his side, to whom he had to point out everything; and by the\\ngreetings and salutations of everybody who met him. As for Alice\\nherself, in her wistfulness and happiness, with only one anxiety\\nremaining in her heart--just enough to give the appealing look which\\nsuited them best to her soft eyes--she was as near beautiful as a woman\\nof her unimposing stature and features could be. She was one of those\\nbrides who appeal to everybody, in the shy radiance of their gladness,\\nto share and sympathize with them. There are some people whose joy is a\\nkind of affront and insult to the sorrowful; but Alice was not one of\\nthese. Perhaps at this supreme hour of her life she was thinking more of\\nthe sad people under the sun--the mourners and sufferers--than she had\\ndone when she used to lie on her sofa at Holmby, and think to herself\\nthat she never would rise from it, and that he never would come. The joy\\nwas to Alice like a sacrament, which it was hard to think the whole\\nworld could not share; and, as her beauty was chiefly beauty of\\nexpression, this tender sentiment shed a certain loveliness over her\\nface as she stood by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s side, with her white veil thrown back, and\\nthe tender countenance, which was veiled in simplicity, and required no\\nother covering, turned towards Ramore. Her one remaining anxiety was,\\nthat perhaps Colinâ\\x80\\x99s mother might not respond to the longing affection\\nthat was in her heart--might not take to her, as she said; and this was\\nwhy her eyes looked so appealing, and besought all the world to love\\nher. When it came to the moment, however--when Colin lifted her out upon\\nthe glistening beach, and put her hand into that of his father, who was\\nwaiting there to receive them, Alice, as was her nature, recovered her\\ncomposure. She held up her soft cheek to Big Colin of Ramore, who was\\nhalf abashed by the action, and yet wholly delighted, although in Scotch\\nreserve he had contemplated nothing more familiar than a hearty clasp of\\nher hand. She was so fair a woman to his homely eyes, and looked so like\\na little princess, that the farmer had scarcely courage to take her into\\nhis arms, or, as he himself would have said, â\\x80\\x9cuse so much freedomâ\\x80\\x9d with\\nsuch a dainty little lady. But Alice had something more important in her\\nmind than to remark Big Colinâ\\x80\\x99s hesitation. â\\x80\\x9cWhere is she?â\\x80\\x9d she cried,\\nappealing to him first, and then to her husband; â\\x80\\x9cwhere is she, Colin?â\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd then they led her up the brae to where the Mistress, trembling and\\nexcited, propped herself up against the porch. Alice sprang forward\\nbefore her escort, when she saw this figure at the door. She left\\nColinâ\\x80\\x99s arm as she had never left it before, and threw herself upon his\\nmother. She took this meeting into her own hands, and accomplished it\\nher own way, nobody interfering. â\\x80\\x9cMamma,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, â\\x80\\x9cI should have\\ncome to you four years ago, and they have never let me come till now. I\\nhave been longing for you all this time. Mamma, kiss me, and say you are\\nglad, for I love you dearly!â\\x80\\x9d cried Alice. As for the Mistress, she\\ncould not make any reply. She said â\\x80\\x9cmy darling!â\\x80\\x9d faintly, and took the\\nclinging creature to her bosom. And this was how the meeting took place,\\nfor which Alice had been longing, as she said, for four long years.\\n\\nWhen they took the bride into the homely parlour of Ramore, and placed\\nher on the old-fashioned sofa, beside the Mistress, it was not without a\\nlittle anxiety that Colin regarded his wife, to see the effect made upon\\nher by this humble interior. But, to look at Alice, nobody could have\\nfound out that she had not been accustomed to Ramore all her life, or\\nthat the Mistress was not her own individual property. It even struck\\nColin with a curious sense of pleasure, that she did not say â\\x80\\x9cmother,â\\x80\\x9d\\nas making a claim on _his_ mother for his sake, but claimed her\\ninstantly as her own, as though somehow her claim had been nearest.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cSometimes I thought of running away and coming to you,â\\x80\\x9d said Alice, as\\nshe sat by the Mistressâ\\x80\\x99s side, in radiant content and satisfaction; and\\nit would be vain to attempt to describe the admiration and delight of\\nthe entire household with Colinâ\\x80\\x99s little tender bride.\\n\\nAs for the Mistress, when the first excitement was over, she was glad to\\nfind her boy by himself for a moment, to bid God bless him, and say what\\nwas in her heart--â\\x80\\x9cIf it wasna that sheâ\\x80\\x99s wiled the heart out of my\\nbreast,â\\x80\\x9d said Mrs. Campbell, putting up her hand to her shining eyes.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cEh, Colin, my man, thank the Lord; itâ\\x80\\x99s like as if it was an angel He\\nhad sent you out of heaven.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cShe will be a daughter to you, mother,â\\x80\\x9d said Colin, in the fulness of\\nhis heart.\\n\\nBut at this two great tears dropped out of Mrs. Campbellâ\\x80\\x99s eyes. â\\x80\\x9cSheâ\\x80\\x99s\\nsweet and bonnie; eh, Colin, sheâ\\x80\\x99s bonnie and sweet! but Iâ\\x80\\x99m an awfuâ\\x80\\x99\\nhardhearted woman,â\\x80\\x9d said the Mistress. â\\x80\\x9cI cannot think ony woman will\\never take _that_ place; Iâ\\x80\\x99m aye so bigoted for my ain; God forgive me;\\nbut her that is my Colinâ\\x80\\x99s wife has nae occasion for ony other name,â\\x80\\x9d\\nshe said with a tender artifice, stooping over her boy and putting back\\nthose great waves of his hair which were the pride of her heart. â\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\nhave none of my ain to go out of my house a bride,â\\x80\\x9d the Mistress added,\\nunder her breath, with one great sob. Colin could not tell why his\\nmother should say such words at such a moment. But perhaps Alice, though\\nshe was not so clever as Colin, had she been there, might have divined\\ntheir meaning after the divination of the heart.\\n\\nIt is hard to see what can be said about a man after he is married,\\nunless he quarrels with his wife and makes her wretched and gets into\\ntrouble, or she does as much for him. This is not a thing which has\\nhappened, or has the least chance of happening, in Colinâ\\x80\\x99s case. Not\\nonly did Alice receive a very flattering welcome in Afton, and, what was\\nstill more gratifying, in St. Ruleâ\\x80\\x99s, where, as most people are aware,\\nvery good society is to be found; but she did more than that, and grew\\nvery popular in the parish, where, to be sure, no curate could have been\\nmore serviceable. She bad undoubted Low Church tendencies, which helped\\nher on with many of the people; and in conjunction with these she had\\nlittle High Church habits, which were very quaint and captivating in\\ntheir way; and, all unconscious as she was of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s views in respect\\nto Church reformation, Alice was â\\x80\\x9cthe means,â\\x80\\x9d as she herself would have\\nsaid, of introducing some edifying customs among the young people of the\\nparish, which she and they were equally unaware were capable of having\\nbeen interpreted to savour of papistry, had the power and inclinations\\nof the Presbytery been in good exercise as of old. As for Colin, he was\\ntamed down in his revolutionary intentions without knowing how. A man\\nwho has given hostages to society, who has married a wife--and\\nespecially a wife who does not know anything about his crotchets, and\\nnever can clearly understand why the bishop (seeing that there certainly\\nis a bishop in the kingdom of Fife, though few people pay any attention\\nto him) does not come to Afton and confirm the catechumens--is scarcely\\nin a position to throw himself headlong upon the established order of\\nthings and prove its futility. No. I. of the â\\x80\\x9cTracts for the Timesâ\\x80\\x9d got\\nprinted certainly, but it was in an accidental sort of way; and, though\\nit cannot be said to have been without its use, still the effect was\\ntransitory, in consequence of the want of continuous effort. No doubt it\\nmade a good deal of sensation in the Scotch papers, where, as such of\\nthe readers of this history as live North of the Tweed may recollect,\\nthere appeared at one time a flood of letters signed by parish ministers\\non the subject. But then, to be sure, it came into the minds of sundry\\npersons that the Church of Scotland had thoughts of going back to the\\nante-Laudian times in robes of penitence, to beg a prayer-book from her\\nricher sister--which was not in the least Colinâ\\x80\\x99s intention, and roused\\nhis national spirit. For we have already found it necessary to say that\\nthe young man, notwithstanding that he had many gleams of insight, did\\nnot always know what he would be at, or what it was precisely that he\\nwanted. What he wanted, perhaps, was to be catholic and belong to\\nChristendom, and not to shut himself up in a corner, and preach himself\\nand his people to death, as he once said. He wanted to keep the\\nChristian feasts, and say the universal prayers, and link the sacred old\\nobservances with the daily life of his dogmatical congregation, which\\npreferred logic. All this, however, he pursued in a milder way after\\nthat famous journey to Windermere, upon which he had set out like a\\nlion, and from which he returned home like a lamb. For it would be\\npainful to think that this faithful but humble history should have\\nawakened any terrors in the heart of the Church of Scotland in respect\\nto the revolutionary in her bosom; and it is pleasant to be able to\\nrestore the confidence, to a certain extent, of the people and\\npresbyters of that venerable corporation. Colin is there, and no doubt\\nhe has his work to do in the world; but he is married and subdued, and\\ngoes about it quietly like a man who understands what interests are\\ninvolved; and up to the present moment he has resisted the urgent\\nappeals of a younger brotherhood, who have arisen since these events, to\\ncontinue the publication of the â\\x80\\x9cTracts for the Times.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIt is at this point that we leave Colin, who has entered on a period of\\nhis life which is as yet unfinished, and accordingly is not yet matter\\nfor history. Some people, no doubt, may be disposed to ask, being aware\\nof the circumstances of his marriage, whether he was happy in his new\\nposition. He was as happy as most people are; and, if he was not\\nperfectly blessed, no unbiassed judge can refuse to acknowledge that it\\nwas his own fault. He was young, full of genius, full of health, with\\nthe sweetest little woman in the kingdom of Fife, as many people\\nthought, for his wife, and not even the troublesome interpellations of\\nthat fantastic woman in the clouds to disturb his repose. She had waved\\nher hand to him for the last time from among the rosy clouds on the\\nnight before his marriage day; for if a manâ\\x80\\x99s marriage is good for\\nanything, it is surely good against the visitings of a visionary\\ncreature who had refused to reveal herself when she had full time and\\nopportunity to do so. And let nobody suppose that Colin kept a cupboard\\nwith a skeleton in it to retire to for his private delectation when\\nAlice was sleeping, as it is said some people have a habit of doing.\\nThere was no key of that description under his pillow; and yet, if you\\nwill know the truth, there was a key, but not of Bluebeardâ\\x80\\x99s kind. It\\nwas a key that opened the innermost chamber, the watch-tower and citadel\\nof his heart. So far from shutting it up from Alice, he had done all\\nthat tender affection could do to coax her in, to watch the stars with\\nhim and ponder their secrets; but Alice had no vocation for that sort of\\nrecreation. And the fact was, that from time to time Colin went in and\\nshut the door behind him, and was utterly alone underneath the distant\\nwistful skies. When he came out, perhaps his countenance now and then\\nwas a little sad; and perhaps he did not see so clear as he might have\\ndone under other circumstances. For Colin, like Lauderdale, believed in\\nthe _quattrâ\\x80\\x99 occhi_--the four eyes that see a landscape at its broadest\\nand heaven at its nearest. But then a man can live without that last\\nclimax of existence when everything else is going on so well in his\\nlife.\\n\\n\\n                               THE END.\\n\\n              LONDON: B.

The little poem in question, which he had entitled\\nâ\\x80\\x9cVespers in the Pantheon,â\\x80\\x9d is, for the satisfaction of his friends,\\ngiven underneath:--\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cWhat voice is in the mighty dome,\\n     Where the blue eye of heaven looks through,\\n     And where the rain falls, and the dew,\\n         In the old heart of Rome?\\n\\n     On the vast area below\\n     Are priests in robes of sullied white\\n     And humble servitors that light\\n         The altars with a feeble glow--\\n\\n     Pale tapers in the twilight dim:\\n     Poor humble folks that come to say\\n     Their farewell to departing day,\\n     Their darkling faith in _Him_,\\n\\n     Who rules imperial Rome the last:\\n     The song is shrill and sad below,\\n     With discords harsh of want and woe\\n         Into the music cast.\\n\\n     But from the mighty vault that bares\\n     Its open heart unto the sky,\\n     Vague peals of anthem sounding high\\n         Echo the human prayers.\\n\\n     Oh solemn shrine, wherein lie dead\\n     The gods of old, the dreams of men!\\n     What voice is this that wakes again\\n         The echoes overhead,\\n\\n     Pealing aloft the holiest name--\\n     The lowliest name, Romeâ\\x80\\x99s ancient scorn--\\n     Now to earthâ\\x80\\x99s furthest boundaries borne,\\n         With fame above all fame?\\n\\n     Is it some soul whose mortal days\\n     Had known no better God than Jove,\\n     Though dimly prescient of a love\\n         Was worthy higher praise?--\\n\\n     Some soul that late hath seen the Lord:\\n     Some wistful soul, eager to share\\n     The tender trust of Christian prayer,\\n         Though not by wish or word:--\\n\\n     By homage inarticulate:\\n     Murmurs and thunders of sweet sound:\\n     And great Amens that circle round\\n         Heavenâ\\x80\\x99s liberal open gate?\\n\\n     Great singer, wert thou one of those\\n     Spirits in prison, whom He sought,\\n     Soon as his wondrous work was wrought,\\n         Ending all doubts and woes?\\n\\n     Alone? or comes there here a throng?\\n     Agrippa--he who built this shrine--\\n     And men who groped for the divine\\n         Through lifetimes hard and long\\n\\n     Dead Romans to this vault austere,\\n     â\\x80\\x99Tis meet ye should return to tell,\\n     Of that which was inscrutable,\\n         That God hath made it clear.\\n\\n     So we, still bound in mortal pain,\\n     Take courage â\\x80\\x99neath the echoing dome,\\n     In the dear heart of this sad Rome,\\n         To give you back--Amen!â\\x80\\x9d\\n[\\nF] â\\x80\\x9cLevo lâ\\x80\\x99incomodo,â\\x80\\x9d a homely expression of Italian politeness on\\nleaving a room.\\n\\n[3] Underneath we give the last copy of nonsense-verses which Colin\\nwas seduced into writing, though the chief interest they possess is\\nchronological, as marking the end of the period of life in which a man\\ncan express himself in this medium. As for Miss Matty, to tell the\\ntruth, she received them with less of her usual good grace than might\\nhave been desired; for, though in her own person she was perfectly\\nreconciled to the loss of his devotion, and quite safe in entertaining\\nthe mildest sentiments of friendship for him, still she was naturally\\nvexed a little to see how he had got over it--which was a thing not\\nto be expected, nor perhaps desired. This however, was the calm and\\nself-controlled tone of Colinâ\\x80\\x99s farewell:--\\n\\n    â\\x80\\x9cBe it softly, slowly said,\\n       With a smile and with a sigh,\\n       While lifeâ\\x80\\x99s noiseless hands untie\\n     Links that youth has made--\\n     Not with sorrow or with tears:\\n     With a sigh for those sweet years,\\n     Drawing slow apart the while;\\n     For those sweetest years a smile.\\n\\n     Thus farewell! The sound is sweet\\n       Parting leaves no sting behind:\\n       One bright chamber of the mind\\n     Closing gracious and complete.\\n     Softly shut the silent door;\\n     Never shade can enter more--\\n     Safe, for what is oâ\\x80\\x99er can last;\\n     Somewhat sad, for it is past.\\n\\n     So farewell! The accents blend\\n       With sweet sounds of life to be;\\n       Never could there dawn for me\\n     Hope of any dearer end.\\n     Dear it is afar to greet\\n     The bright path before thy feet,\\n     Thoughts that do thy joy no wrong\\n     Chiming soft the even-song,\\n     Till morn wakes the bridal bell\\n     Fair and sweet, farewell! farewell!â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\n[4] Numbers I. and II. of the Scotch _Tracts for the Times_, together\\nwith fragments of subsequent numbers uncompleted, will be given, if\\ndesired by Colinâ\\x80\\x99s friends, in the appendix to the second edition of\\nthis biography.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Son of the Soil, by Mrs. Margaret Oliphant\\n\\n\""
