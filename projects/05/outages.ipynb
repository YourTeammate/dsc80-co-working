    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we will look at the major power outage data in the continental U.S. from January 2000 to July 2016. After data cleaning, the dataset has 1534 observations (each occurence of outage), and 56 columns (location, cause, influential factors, time-stamp, aftermath of the outage etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification problem is that we want to predict the **cause category** (target variable) for each major power outages given the year, the state, outage duration, population of the state, number of customers affected for each state (features). And we'll use **Recall** as our evaluation metric to examine our model, and make further improvements based on the value. The justification for this metric over others will be given in Baseline model section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "Our baseline model uses the Decision Tree Classifier, since the `CAUSE.CATEGORY` consists of 7 categories,and including 5 features: [`'YEAR'`, `'U.S._STATE'`, `'OUTAGE.DURATION'`, `'POPULATION'`, `'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED'`]. Of which, `YEAR` column is ordinal, `U.S. STATE` is nominal, and remaining three columns are quantitative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we choose year as one of the features is that as time progresses, we guessed that cause category might also change correspondingly due to technological improvement. We chose state since the geography, demography, consumption varies among different states, which might have an effect on power outage. We chose outage duration, since the length of each outage can depend on the severity, which also closely linked to the cause category. The population is feasible since the population is a straight forward representation of the scale of the state, difference in population might also affect the cause. At last, if cause category belongs to a macro scale influence, naturally many customers will be affected, making customers affected another viable feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition,choosing a good evaluation metric is quite challenging,since the `CAUSE.CATEGORY` has 7 causes for the outage, each with very diverse amount (using value_counts), it's relatively hard to calculate recall, specifity, precision, and etc., only if we repeat them for each category (it will be much easier to work with since they are for binarized-categorical variable like the tumor/no tumor, or terrorists/non-terrorists example). To tackle this problem, we first define a variable `categories` that includes all causes, and then assign it for the keyword argument `labels` for the confusion matrix. To better visualize True Positive, False Positive, False Negative and True Negative, we used multi-labeled confusion matrix that displays all seven categories respectively in a more visually straightforward 2x2 matrices. Parallel to our expectation, the multi-label confusion matrix has matching True Positives as values on the diagonal line of the ordinary confusion matrix. Since there are 7 categories, and they have unequal proportion, we value True Positives over all observations that are actually labeled positive the most (unlike tumor problem, True Negative doesn't give much information in this case, recall is most helpful),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm Recall} =\\frac{TP}{P} =\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which follows that we will use `Recall` as our evaluation metric. More specifically, we will take the mean of all 7 categories' `recall` as the evaluation metric using `recall_score`. However, our evaluation metric can be further improved since we consider the case where TP = 0 and TP + FN = 0 to get a recall of 0 (but if FN is non-zero, TP is 0, we also get 0, they don't mean the same thing since TP + FN = 0 suggests that there are no positive labels in the input data). \n",
    "\n",
    "After training our baseline model, it has a mean of 0.464 recall over all categories on testing dataset, which is quite decent considering we have 7 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "To achieve our final model, we attempted 2 feature engineering that would theoretically improve our evaluation metric. We first calculates the population density using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm Population\\ density} = \\frac {POPPCT\\_URBAN * POPDEN\\_URBAN + (1 - POPPCT\\_URBAN) * POPDEN\\_RURAL}{100} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We think that it will be a very effective feature that could potentially increase our recall score, since population density can be an indicative measure for different causes. For example, major outages that occur within areas with higher population density might due to `system operability disruption`. The second is StandardScaler. It will transform our data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. We applied this on other numeric columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these two additional features, we have increased our recall score to 0.593. Then, we performed Grid Search on this final pipeline to obtain the final model for our prediction. It gives that the best pipeline parameters are: {'dtc__max_depth': 5, 'dtc__min_samples_leaf': 2, 'dtc__min_samples_split': 17}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model can be further improved if Grid Search is able to optimize parameters based on recall score rather than accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "To assess the fairness and bias of our model, we specifically chose the column `POPPCT_URBAN` to construct our X and Y subsets and hypothesized that the urban population percentage doesn't affect our recall scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will binarize our datasets into:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1`: which has `POPPCT_URBAN` higher than the median urban population percentage;\n",
    "\n",
    "`0`: which are lower than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our test statistic would be the **absolute difference** between the **recall score** of these two subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Null Hypothesis***: Urban population percentage, either higher or lower than its' median, doesn't have an effect on our recall score.(i.e. the difference between the recall scores between two subsets are due to chance)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Alternative Hypothesis***: The urban population percentage does influence our recall score on two subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running 1000 permutation tests, we obtained a p-value of 0.762, rejecting the null hypothesis that the urban population percentage does influence our recall score on two subsets. Suggesting that the fairness can be further improved."
